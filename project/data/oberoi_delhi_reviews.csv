"Excellent and highly recommended!   We only spent two nights at The Oberoi in Delhi but left wanting to return.  This was our first time staying at an Oberoi property but would consider them on par with a Four Seasons or Mandarin.  The room was well appointed, the staff was excellent and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  We only had breakfast at the hotel, but it has an excellent variety, and everything was delicious.    Special thanks to Vinayak and his team who made such a lasting impression and to Mr. Rathore for his management of such a fine hotel.  ",Date of stay: November 2022,bubble_50,
"This was our favourite hotel whilst we visited India. It has recently been refurbished to an extremely high standard and all the staff act with complete professionalism.  Our first stay was brief but managed to eat the chefs tasting menu which was brilliant.  Our second visit we were upgraded free of charge. We were celebrating our engagement and our room had a huge bouquet of flowers, cake and a petal filled bath. We ordered room service which was restaurant quality.

"Perhaps my favorite hotel in the world.  This is a genuinely great hotel.  The service, the amenitites and the food are all exceptional.  It really is a gem in New Delhi.  The hotel is beautifully maintained, sparklingly so, in an enviroment where that is sometimes difficult.  The air quality and filtration systems really do make a difference, in an area where the outdoor air quality is very challenging.  The gym, the spa and the salon are all absolutly worth a visit.  All well appointed and with exceptional levels of service.  The hotel laundry and butler service are exceptional.

So the best thing they have is their staff. They lose 3 more stars because of their lack of response when i have been asking them to refund the deposit i made for January 2023 booking because i had change of plans.  they are sitting on $ 2900 deposit and won't refund despite several requests.

"The Oberoi Delhi is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in, both because of the hotel itself and the absolutely amazing staff. Every single member of the staff knew what we needed before we even knew ourselves. They also remembered us and our preferences (for example, Samanth checked us in on our first day and arranged coffee for my husband, and on our last day my husband requested a coffee from him and he remembered his preferences for light milk). When we asked for something, even unusual requests, they took it in stride and were able to make it happen quickly and with kindness.

Their service is really a class apart, just praises to the entire staff at breakfast, during check in and check out and during our entire 4 day stay. Few names I remember was Aratrik who was a great help during Check in and check out, Sanga who helped keep our room spick n span and also provided great turn down service. The Manager at the time of duty (why cant I remember his name!?! aargh) during our check in was so sweet to double upgrade us when he came to know we were travelling with our daughter to a premier plus room with was bigger and so much more comfortable.

"Exceptional indeed! This was the first Oberoi we’d ever stayed in - we went on to stay in two more Oberoi’s on our Indian tour. The New Delhi hotel was the stand-out best of all 5 hotels we stayed in. It is the most awful looking building, especially from the back, but I’ll pass on that as you don’t tend to spend too much time gazing at your hotel from the outside. The knockout factor here is the staff. Not one dud amongst them - they are all clearly brilliant trained. This made our stay so enjoyable. Next, our room. We paid for an upgrade to a suite - room 512 - which was very comfortable. Entrance area, separate WC, sitting room, separate bedroom and bathroom.

"The Oberoi brand's reputation is so well known and as our first visit to an Oberoi property, we were not disappointed. Not only were the rooms well furnished but they had some of the best wheelchair accessible bathrooms that we have encountered. That was impressive.

Cirrus 9 was good but the first two wines we ordered were out of stock, minor disappointment but not common at luxury hotels.  Spa was striking and the services very good.

"We live in the US, however we have travelled extensively throughout India over the past 20 years. The Oberoi is one of a few hotels we have found that truly offers a 5-star experience. The property is beautiful. Drinks at the rooftop bar are top notch. The pool is heated and nicely landscaped. The food is excellent. Staff is very helpful. I emailed the concierge multiple times before we arrived at the hotel for advice on things we wanted to do in the city. They were pleasant and helpful.   I believe the property is undergoing some upgrades. The hallways are somewhat dated, however the rooms are excellent.

"I've stayed at the Oberoi, New Delhi a few times, and my most recent experience was today. During my past stays I've found the Oberoi service to be truly exceptional always, however post Pandemic, I think the brand is losing its sheen.   We stayed overnight yesterday.

The breakfast this morning was again not the 5 star level of service. And again the managers were there to offer their apologies.  The check-out, could again be smoother, and again we heard sorry.

"We arrived in Delhi in the wee hours only to find the airline had lost our daughter’s luggage. The job the concierge team did to reunite her will her belongings was nothing short of remarkable. But everything about this hotel is remarkable.  It was the beauty of the rooms in the online photos that caused us to book our stay and they didn’t disappoint. These are beautiful rooms. Yet what we found even more beautiful was the humanity of the people working here. They really care. Everything was done as perfectly as it could be done. From the cleanliness, to the facilities, to the food everything was done just right.   And start your day with the breakfast buffet. It will make you happy.

"The story started after we ate at Baoshuan and headed downstairs to exit the hotel with all-smiles.

Who is she to decide my comfort? My infant is hungry and they care about the lobby looks.

I do sincerely apologize, however I believe that it has been misconstrued. I understand the location was outside the cloakrooms. The passage where you were seated also leads to the Men’s cloakroom. Our intention was to provide a private and a comfortable space. There is a possibility that Meher wasn’t articulate enough in her offer and you didn’t feel her sensitivity and sincerity, she is still new and learning. I have personally spoken to her in this regard.   We at The Oberoi Hotels and Resorts have nothing against breastfeeding and we also understand that our lady guests, most of the times, prefer some privacy to breastfeed their baby. Anytime we see this in the public area, we always offer a place which is more private and comfortable. As you have yourself mentioned, Ibrahim did just that.  Once again, we are extremely sorry, our good intentions were not meant to show any disrespect in the manner it has come across to you.

"I simply do NOT have time to write reviews. However, Oberoi chain in general and New Delhi in particular didnt leave with me with a choice.

The genuine care the team affords their guests and a true sense of joy they seem to derive in service - this is hard to replicate.   I just have 2 complaints with Oberoi's - there are too few properties around the world - wish they expand fast and secondly they have managed to somewhat dampen our experience at any other hotel/resort during our future global travels - it will be hard for others to meet our now lofty expectations!

"It starts with the drive up to the hotel, the sweeping driveway with the plush foliage, arriving onto a grand porch with a crisp and warm greeting, the most welcoming staff and that beautiful lobby. The service at the Oberoi is like no other, whether its in the restaurants (360 being a favorite) or with the concierge team (who will go above and beyond), to the bell boys (always helpful and anticipate ones every need), to the salon and of course housekeeping (who remember what you like and make sure its always in the room.)

"I enjoyed a week at the Delhi Oberoi and loved the hotel, especially the room, which while not very big was perfectly designed with everything almost anyone, certainly I, would desire. Recommend paying for a golf course facing room on a higher floor- well worth it. However the exceptional service from the welcome outside to the pool service and everything in between, is what really sets Oberoi properties apart. Visited several of the restaurants all of which were wonderful and the daily breakfasts were a highlight.

Once you booked an office room to work in, someone would bring you a drink/snack of your choice.   The indoor and outdoor pool is also a mini oasis; the dark blue tile adds lusciousness to the facilities.   Can’t say enough about the hotel and the hospitality I was graced with.

"Oberoi truly does one thing better than it’s competitors, that is hospitality. In the space of business hotels in cities. Oberoi stands out with its ultra comfortable and hospitable stays. The hotel stands true to this, much likes its counterparts in Mumbai, Bangalore - two of which I have frequented. This being my first stay at the Delhi one. Overall it has been a great stay. The staff as usual makes you feel more than welcome! Special mention to Manthan at the front desk and Abhishek at the amazing Cirrus9 bar.  However it disappoints and it sucks to say this, Oberoi Delhi lacks a general sense of warmth what is usually an Oberoi staple.

Who,I have to shake my head in wonder, at the Oberoi spends so much time thinking about these little things. And yet this is the same hotel which shut itself down for nearly two years to effect a massive transformation. The Oberoi group seems to effortlessly move throught the whole spectrum of innovation for customer experience. Of course everything was brilliant. But that is always the case at any Oberoi stay.

Thank you so much Oberoi Delhi for your great services by some really great and beautiful people in the property. They tried their best to make our trip really memorable.

"It had been months since we had stepped out of the apartment—for obvious reasons, of course.   When we got a reason to celebrate, we decided to do a staycation in Delhi. While we’re Hyatt loyalists, we wanted to try something different and The Oberoi topped the list on Trip Advisor, so that's what we chose to spend the weekend.  Since the wife is a celiac, it’s always important for us to put in a word with a hotel we wish to stay at, in advance, so that they can take care of her dietary needs. I sent a note to the General Manager, requesting his attention. Jay (the GM) his team were quick to respond, positively.

My wife and 2.5 year old daughter Antara would nod in agreement when I say that one will have to keep thinking forever to find even one or two areas of improvement; it's just that impeccable.  First, the pre-checkin experience. I think within a couple of days of making the reservation, I was contacted by Vinayak, and he stayed in touch with me, till the time I checked out. He took every bit of care to ensure that any and all of my apprehensions and requests were noted and taken care of even before I arrived at the hotel.

Every thing was superbb  Just a request as we have one child so you should try to change the policy at least for family for occupancy of child with the parents.

I take this opportunity to thank you for your time in evaluating our product and services. It gives me immense joy to know that you enjoyed your stay with us.   Our hotel rooms and suites are built in a manner that is comfortable for two guests and are appointed with amenities in a similar manner. We do allow children aged 12 years and below to share the same room as the parents, however we feel that beyond that age, a child might need more space than that available in one room. Also the presence of an extra bed reduces the space to move around in the room, and if one is on a vacation, space constraints can be quite a hindrance.  As a hotel company, our guests’ comfort is our top most priority and we believe in accommodating as many preferences as we can. We do understand the importance and value of family vacations and time spent together and hence we have a number of interconnected set of rooms and suites. We always recommend this to guests who travel as a family, so that you can stay connected throughout without compromising on comfort.

"I have never previously stayed at somewhere so beautiful & with such delightful staff. My room was beautiful with plenty of room, a walk in wardrobe & stunning bathroom. There was fruit in my room on arrival & plenty of tea & coffee (Nespresso) making facilities. The bed was extremely comfortable. The food was marvellous & at breakfast the staff even brought me a tray of small quantities of typical Indian breakfast foods to try if I wanted too.

"We worked directly with an Oberoi Destination Expert at The Oberoi Group to plan a wonderful 12 night trip to see Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Udaipur.  They were so helpful and thoughtful in creating an itinerary of memorable stays at each of the Oberoi properties at these locations.  Working directly with Oberoi gave us peace of mind that all details would be covered, and came with more amenities for less cost than working with a third party tour operator or web booking service.

"This is a lovely hotel and a real 5 star property. The rooms and bathrooms are spacious and nicely decorated. They have butler service. It is truly an oasis in the middle of a crazy city. New Deli is a much nicer part , but there is a lot of security so don’t be surprised.  Turndown service is a little early at 5 PM.  We did find it odd that the concierge kept trying to direct us to a private car for transport to a nearby restaurant for dinner. They said it was  a 15 minute ride by cab, but they kept discouraging us from using them. They said they couldn’t guard service. We used Uber which worked like a charm and was only $2 each way.  Breakfast has an extensive selection of foods to choose from. Service was slow the second day.

Peaceful oasis in the middle of the city. Beautiful hotel and location. Incredible staff - every one of them. Professional and gracious. Amazing food and service.

"I’ve stayed in countless hotels all over the world, at all levels, and this really the best city hotel I’ve ever stayed in. The recent refurbishment has been done with exceptional taste and the quality is top notch throughout the hotel in both the public spaces and the rooms. The reception area is tasteful yet very elegant. Each room has a picture window that overlooks either the golf course or a UNESCO site and is very tastefully equipped. The standard rooms are not huge but average size but they are equipped so well you don’t really need more space for a couple. Bathrooms work perfectly and have all the amenities you need.

"I have diligently read and watched videos about The Oberoi ND when I planned for our vacation, and felt to have become an overnight expert of its history and alI. I generally opted for the best accommodations and services on our trip to India. My expectations of their ND location (as we stayed in the Oberoi Mumbai as well) were met on point- from the greet in airport, to their Mercedes S class transfer service, to their professional driver Matin, and warm welcome from the staff right upon stepping on their premises- you’re one VIP in their eyes.

Excellent check-in experience in the room not at the reception desk.  Check-out was a complete disaster: we travelled in a group of 3 families and had 3 rooms. We asked the reception to combine all extras and divide it equally into 3 and allocate to each room.

"This is a really memorable hotel. As someone who spends 50-75 nights in hotels annually around the world, I was really impressed by the Oberoi. The staff was attentive without overdoing it. The food (lunch buffet) was really delicious. The hotel itself is immaculate and well designed. And, I was able to get a personalised tour (thank you Ali!) under pretty strict time constraints.

"My family of 4 (2 small boys) stayed here this week and loved the high tech room and entire place. We were in room 501 and the Staff were so attentive and the butler service was incredible. Mr Ibrahim Magdum, Ms Shreya at guest relations and Mr Aslafaan our waiter/butler were outstanding, as was Ms Esther at reception for breakfast. The food was brilliant for the in room dining and we made use of the complimentary pop corn we could order with our in room movie. The staff love children and everything you can imagine is catered for. My husband and I will be cancelling our future room bookings in other Delhi hotels in favour of this going forward.

"Property was nice and check in was super friendly. However, the 24 hours restaurant was disappointing. Have an extensive menu, but quite a number of it are not available during off-peak hours, and there was no indication whatsoever, making ordering a hassle as the waiter have to inform us at every turn what we order was not available.  And what is worse, my evisu jeans was damaged by them. I regret not checking before I left the hotel. The instruction given for the wash was not followed and I came back to Singapore with a shock when I unpack the jeans from the bag. It was faded and with what look like bits of tissue / fabric on it. ",Date of stay: February 2020,bubble_30,"Dear Guest,  It was a pleasure having you stay with us on your recent visit.  Threesixty which is our main all-day dining restaurant serves cuisines from around the world.  Whilst most of the menu is served throughout the day, there are certain dishes which are cooked in a ‘tandoor’ and ‘sushi section’ which are served during lunch and dinner only, for both these sections it is clearly mentioned in the menu along with the time that they are served. We don’t mention the time in front of each dish as it would make the menu look cluttered. The Tandoor periodically needs to be cleaned and filled with charcoal and for this reason there needs to be a gap in service.  Research shows that  ‘Sushi’ is demanded during peak meal timings and therefore we do not offer it through the day.  As far as your ‘jeans’ are concerned, I have spoken to our Laundry Manager who personally supervises processing of all garments that come with special instructions.  The jeans were washed ‘inside-out’ and returned in the very condition it was received. In folding, there is a possibility that the tissue paper used may have clung to the fabric but can be very easily removed.  We are confident that even after this, if you are dis-satisfied, please courier the jeans to us and we will be happy to restore the product.  I will be happy to pay for the courier charges as well.  At the end of the day, your satisfaction is paramount. Our singular goal is guest delight, we will not leave any stone unturned.  I am happy that you enjoyed the rest of the hotel.

"We stayed at the Oberoi New Delhi right after it reopened, and it was wonderful. We recently stayed again and it was even better. The hotel is still beautiful, but now the service is even better! Our room was gorgeous, and the concierge and front desk could not have been more helpful. The rooms are spacious, and the bathrooms are luxurious. The concierge was super helpful both before and during our trip and arranged dinner reservations and tours. The food at 360 and Omya was delicious. Breakfast was a real treat (chole with puris and parathas). The biryani at Omya was sublime (and served in a lovely setting). We also enjoyed a light snack at the patisserie. The gym was great and not too busy.

"We were only there for one night to catch our return flight leaving from Delhi. On our journey there we were delayed by 6 hours due to the fog/smog so we got to the hotel at almost midnight.... but we were welcomed as warmly as ever, and the speed of service at check-in (we'd told them we were tired) couldn't have been quicker. Our room was gorgeous and crammed with so much gadgetry that I'd have to stay a week to understand it. In the hour or so I was up, I gleaned I could control everything from a tablet (electronic, not the medicinal sort) including the curtains, TV, lighting and quite possibly the weather, which presumably the bastard before us had set on smog-mode.

"On our second night, as we were about to enter the elevator, a guy in black from the front desk came rushing to us saying our visa is expired. This caused us to panic as we know it is not. He was referring to oue e-visa that has an expiration for ETA. Sure enough, upon checking our passports oyr visa still had 20 days left before it expires. This guy was so arrogant to accept his mistake even infront of his supervisor. He kept insisting he was right until his supervisor told him to shut up. They were apologetic but the panic, stress, embarrassment and inconvinience they caused us made some of us want to leave the hotel the next day. We were also overcharged in our buffet lunch.

I am disheartened that you did not enjoy your stay with us at The Oberoi New Delhi because of the aforementioned incident. If I may take a moment and explain, Indian law mandates that all passports & visas to be collected – in this case while e visa was submitted to us, the immigration stamp date on the passport which defines validity was not collected. The Duty Manager was trying to explain the same, but as your guests did not speak and had limited understanding of English, they probably misunderstood his intent and were perturbed. As far as the inaccurate charge in restaurant is concerned, it was an inadvertent human error where the server should have charged INR 30000/- , however, he charged INR 300000/- this was immediately realized, apologized and corrected. I can well understand, your guests probably did not enjoy the hotel as they would have, had these incidents not taken place.    Please accept my sincere most apologies for the inconvenience we have caused you.

"Had the opportunity to stay at the newly refurbished Oberoi in Dehli for three nights. To summarize it succinctly – you basically cannot go wrong here. The general experience is really very positive and I would be very happy to return the next time in Delhi. On the plus side, the hotel is extremely well-appointed, it has a very high service orientation, the air quality system is definitely a strong plus, and it has a great location in Delhi. Also, the rooftop bar is a must – very cool. All of that being said – there were indeed a few aspects that drew away from the perfect experience.

"Started recent visit to India with two nights at the Oberoi New Delhi.  Seamless service begins with an attentive airport meet and greet in a hotel Mercedes. Throughout, this level of service “always aiming to do their utmost” continued.  The breakfasts were very good with a nice representation of Indian as well as classic Western items. The rooms were comfortable and clean but otherwise not spectacular.  The only negative comment I have relates to the comparative high price for unscheduled expenses. For example our flight for an organized tour arrived at an early time of 4:50 am and by the time we got to the hotel it was barely 5:30 am. The night manager explaining that as normal checkin was 12 pm there would be an extra days charge of 27,000 INR if they gave us a room…",Date of stay: December 2019,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,   It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi on your recent visit.

Sir I do understand completely that you were bothered by having to pay a higher price for the room night from before, I hope you can understand our predicament - because at 5 AM in the morning, when the rooms are booked to capacity a night prior, while a lot of times guests do we leave early in the morning and therefore between the night manager and the morning manager all that change was inventory and the room did eventually become available to us and hence we gave it to you.

"Lovely new modern rooms, but that is not all from house keeping to F&B, they are the heart and soul of every Oberoi hotel. The guest is treated with great understanding and generosity...any body who stays there knows this and if there is an Oberoi at that spot we will not choose another hotel.  Kudos to their internal communication with each other; everyone knows what you need, what you prefer and what you wish to be corrected. They got to know that we did not like something they did not charge us for it. Thank you Anshum you will be remembered for your hospitality!

"Obviously one of the finest hotel chain in the world. The Oberoi New Delhi is undoubtedly a fantastic property and truly signifies the reputation of 'The Oberoi'. The staff members are very efficient and attentive, always trying to enhance the comfort and convenience of their guests thus making it a memorable stay in New Delhi. We stayed four nights in room no.106 and it was simply fascinating.  It is worthwhile to mention that few security personnel paying less attention to guests who are coming through rented cabs rather than those who are visiting with their expensive vehicles.

"The Oberoi is refreshed, renewed not just in space but also in its spirit. The staff is courteous, the rooms are fabulous and i would say it’s probably the only Indian five star that pays attention to its Indian food.   The breakfast buffet is a winner with a placard prodding you to ask for fresh Puri, paratha, dosa from the kitchen. But the highlight for me is that i requested for 2 medu wadas and i got exactly 2 and freshly fried  ones (quite a departure from other five stars which send many to your table and refried).",Date of stay: October 2019,bubble_50,"Dear Guest, It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi on your recent visit.

This is a sophisticated first-class 8-story luxury hotel - located in a huge garden-like setting. While built in the 1960s, the hotel went through a two year “down to the walls” renovation recently which I describe as a howling success. The hotel looks new inside. Our suite had every high-tech and luxury touch. Fast internet. Easy to use labeled light switches. Huge storage space. Big desk. The place is quiet. No night noise that we could hear.

"There’s a TV embedded in the bathroom mirror and the entire room is controlled by iPad, including the food! If you watch a movie in your room the iPad provides an option to have free pop corn delivered to your room and it’s yummy! If your after something to eat that is more on the bland side, the stir fry Vege in soy and garlic is really nice as is the welcome drink called The Oberoi Fix which oddly no other Oberoi Hotel makes.

Beside, I felt more nice feeling with Oberoi Bangalore and Oberoi Amarvilas. The hotel staff are very kind and supportive from bottom of their heart. I liked Oberoi New Delhi very much, truly.

"We booked this hotel as part of a Luxury Escapes package. Despite its almost Soviet exterior, the insides and surrounding area ooze super luxury. Its many highlights include: . Extraordinary rooms with the controls of just about everything contained in an iPad. The rooms have more things than you need including a TV in the bathroom mirror. . Great views of Humayun’s Tomb or the golf course which appears from above as a forest. . A rooftop bar catching those great views. . A beautiful pool at which you are immediately supplied with water, sun screen, insect repellent and towels. . Wonderful breakfast with many Western  and Indian choices. . Excellent yoga classes.

View overlooking golfing and one of two HUGE Olympic size outdoor pools (so enticing that I was tempted to BUY swimware just so that I could take a dip in the pools).   Many outstanding restaurants (breakfast buffet was extensive featuring many varieties of eastern and western specialties - the bread section alone rivaled a stand alone bakery) outstanding brassiere, mini shopping, a guest relaxation bar with top shelf liqour and butler, smoking bar, plus the regular bar, spa and more!

Room , Butler and Laundry Service was extraordinary. efficient energetic and proactive. My room was on the first floor so had a bad terrace view .

My friend & I visited this Oberoi Hotel for 3 nights recently. From the moment we were collected from the airport till the time we left for the Oberoi Hotel in Agra we were greeted with offers of assistance & helpful information as it was my first visit to India. The range of food offered for breakfast was excellent.  We particularly loved our meal at the Chinese restaurant on the 7th Floor where again all the staff we encountered were happy & engaging. The food was exquisite. Our room was generous in size with a super large window.

Just stayed at the newly renovated oberois New Delhi. I Had a oberois suite and I must say I loved how they have used technology with the iPad which is your single point of contact for everything. The room service food was excellent the high tea at 360 is also really nice but still long way to go compared to the ones in London. It would have been a 5 star experience if not for the butler.   When I checked in my butler came and greeted me and said if u need anything please do let me know. Next day when we called for him the butler had changed and a lady butler came who was unhelpful and impolite not  the type of courtesy I expect from oberois.

Each floor has a butler assigned to it, and they change each shift.

"The Oberio Hotel in New Delhi is iconic and has taken class, culture, heritage and hospitality to an entirely new level of excellence. The etiquette and refined manners of every staff at the hotel must be emulated by all those aspiring to get into the hospitality industry.

"Our 1st time in India and impressed by the security set up at all Oberoi hotels we stayed at around cultural triangle.  I won’t repeat many of the good comments of others - photos also speak for themselves.  A beautiful luxury/modern hotel with filtered air and water on tap...a peaceful sanctuary from both the intense traffic and smog of Delhi - a fascinating city but pollution and divide between rich and poor shocks even those who’ve traveled widely through Asia, Sth America etc.  We hope Oberoi hotels contribute to greater opportunities for the less fortunate?

"We stayed here for two days as this hotel was rated high. The service was really excellent and you were treated real well. The pool and the gym were high class! But  I think a cup coffee that costs 9€ should taste a lot better. The indian restaurant was outstanding. Even though, If I travelled to Delhi again I would stay in a hotel that's more authentic Indian. The most interesting part of our stay has to be the rickshaw-drivers guiding to the perfect attractions nearby, such as Lodhi garden an the Indian gate.

I was staying at an Oberoi property after 5years. This hotel is centrally located and therefore any landmark in Delhi would be within 10-20mins drive.  Check in was really smooth and Yajat and team made sure we move into the room at the earliest. We had a golf course view room which gigantic bathroom. The sunset view from the room is gorgeous. The best way of this newly done up room is the fancy gadgets that it has. iPad that pretty controls everything in the room and a super fancy screen inlaid in the bathroom mirror -should you get an urge to watch something while you brush your teeth.

The refurbished rooms, common areas, and restaurants are all beautiful. The electronics in the room, including the iPad that controls everything, are top rate, as are the bathroom and the beds. We booked a luxury room, which had an incredible view of the city and Humayun’s Tomb in the distance.  Most rooms have king size beds, though we were able to get a room with two twin beds (as requested).  What truly sets the Oberoi apart from other hotels in India (and the world) is the service.

We spent three nights at this hotel as part of a trip to India. We were told that it had recently been refurbished. That was gross understatement as the hotel has been completely remodelled. The bedrooms and ensuite bathrooms are amongst the largest we have stayed in and the walk in closet was enormous.  The grounds are lovely and the facilities first class. we ate in all three restaurants and the food was excellent particularly the Indian restaurant which I am sure will get a Michelin star in due course.

"We did an Oberoi Golden Triangle tour and stayed in three different Oberoi hotels during our stay. Our stay in each one of them was perfect. In New Delhi we would like to give a special thanks to Mona at the concierge desk who organized everything for us, cars, taxis, guides, reservations..... Thanks to her everything went very smoothly. The hotel is new, modern and very comfortable. Rooms are exactly what you expect. We stayed three nights and three very comfortable nights. We used the inside pool and the gym and we loved it.

"There's nothing palatial about the Oberoi Delhi, a modern stucco rectangle, but everything within is first-rate. The rooms - even the sunshades - are ipad controlled. Our room overlooked a forest and the Delhi golf club. The bathroom was quite large, with an excellent walk-in shower. Wi-fi worked throughout the hotel. The rooftop bar, open air on a pleasant March evening, offered great views of the city at night. The breakfast buffet was all encompassing. We can recommend the Shakshuka, eggs poached in Middle Eastern spices and tomatoes. I don't recommend the bitter melon juice (but who would?)

Onto the rooms, they were very very modern, a tablet controlled all the main functions of the room like the blinds, entertainment e.t.c. very well thought of and conceived.

The rooms were large, with separate bathroom and dressing area, my room had a view of the maze, which was a little surprising, and the whole place was spotless. Each day after work I looked forward to my return. Also, randomly, the housekeeper would leave small gifts, which was lovely, I almost became programmed to look whenever I returned, everything from mouthwash to a tablet cleaning kit...

"Having turned 65 I went to the Oberoi in Delhi for the vacation of a lifetime.  A rather rude and nasty young man at the concierge desk nearly destroyed it. I went to the concierge desk after checking in to arrange a day trip to the Taj Mahal.  This young man told me that they could arrange a day trip for about a thousand dollars.  That is about five times the cost that I had seen on the net and frankly more than I could afford.  I was already spending about $2,500 staying at their hotel for a few days. He said that was all they could offer me.  There are no travel agents or tour operators in the vicinity of the hotel. My trip of a lifetime was shattered. I went back to my room devastated.  A few hours later I decided to try one more time.  I went back down to the concierge desk…",Date of stay: February 2019,bubble_50,"Dear Guest, It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi on your recent visit.

"Stayed for 3 nights as part of a 7 day trip thru Rajasthan, Agra and Delhi. The renovation has been great and the rooms are fantastic. Though I booked 2 luxury rooms which supposedly had a view of Humayun’s tomb or the golf course, from the 2nd floor you see neither. Didnt complain after arriving from a delayed flight and spending some ‘quality time’ in Delhi traffic.  Went down for dinner to Omya, was told to wait for 10 mins to see if they could accomodate a party of 6. Then told they could not. Went back and ordered room service and then got a call that a table was available. Had no interest by then, but dont blame them as I had no reservations given the late arrival.

Every staff member seems to go out of their way to satisfy guests.  They could not have been nicer or more accommodating at every turn. The rooms are terrific.  The I-pad controls are amazing, as is the Wi-Fi.  The bathrooms are superb - among the best anywhere.  And housekeeping is topnotch. The swimming pool and spa areas are also exceptional. Breakfasts are perfect and Bao Shuan is amazing (see separate review).

It has now had a thorough re-fit, and on a visit in November 2018, was in excellent form.  The Italian restaurant on the ground floor is now a high-end Indian, and the Asian restaurant on the top floor has been re-purposed as a high-end Chinese.

"Over the centuries many of India's precious stones have found their way out of the country, but this is one crown jewel that has stayed put. Whilst India is a must see travel destination, Delhi itself can be an assault on the senses, good and bad. In the midst of the mayhem the Oberoi is a real sanctuary. After a long day of exploring, returning to the hotel was a breath of fresh air - literally, as the climate and particle control was very appreciated. We stayed for about a week and loved every minute of it; we took advantage of every amenity, restaurant, gym and spa and all are outstanding.

"I stayed at the Oberoi New Delhi as part of a small tour group.  The hotel location is great, very close to the city center but in a quiet area next to a golf course.  The restaurants are excellent and the recently redecorated rooms and public areas are beautiful and immaculate.  But the best thing about it was service.  When I checked in I was limping from a minor foot injury in traveling.  My housekeeper, Susan, immediately brought me an ice pack and frequently brought fresh ice and a smile.

When I come to Delhi it's really vital when I arrive at my hotel I escape the crazy outside. I felt Oberoi was just as busy inside as out! It's a luxury property and I have stayed at their other property in Agra which was incredible. It's really popular with long wait times for the public areas. I also really have an issue with the spray in the hallways. It's a heavy perfumed scent. The spa is incredible. Pool staff very attentive. All over it should be the number one in Delhi. But it lacks the warmth of Leela palace and even Clarindges and just isn't worth the price point in my opinion. As I said when I come into my hotel from the Delhi traffic I want scenerity. Oberoi was just too busy for me. The gym was crammed each day and the staff check in was not smooth.

I take this opportunity to thank you for your time in evaluating our product and services.   I have taken a careful note of your comment regarding the location. The Oberoi, New Delhi is centrally located and overlooks the prestigious Delhi Golf Club on one side and the World Heritage Monument- Humayun’s Tomb on the other. Furthermore, it has close proximity to the commercial and shopping districts and the major sightseeing attractions of Delhi. While the hotel is closely located to the above mentioned locations, I agree to the fact that we do suggest that our guests use a car to reach these places, except for the Delhi Golf Club. The reason for this is that though these locations are within walking distance, for example Khan Market itself is only a ten minute walk away from the hotel, the roads and pavements are not conducive to walking. Furthermore the traffic in New Delhi is quite unpredictable and busy, to add to that the air quality in Delhi is not the best, hence we suggest that our guests use a car to reach these places. If you are interested in going for a walk, then we would love to suggest The Lodhi Gardens, which is a five minute drive away.  I am delighted to know that you enjoyed shopping in Khan Market. It is a classy and posh market and is a favourite amongst the expatriate community. I agree that there are no shops that encourage bargaining here, but rest assured, the prices of the items are true to the quality of the products available. In case you do wish to visit a similar market where bargaining is encouraged for your next visit, which we hope is soon enough, then we would like to suggest the Dilli Haat and the market in Connaught Place or Janpath to you. For your next visit to the hotel, we would love to introduce you to our Luxury Manager, Mona, who can help you in planning an exciting itinerary, keeping in mind your interests.

"Our family stayed at the Oberoi in late December and really had a wonderful experience. We arrived from the airport with the airline having lost our luggage and the hotel supplied us with toiletries, sleepwear, complimentary laundry and a car to the local market.

Service was always exceptional and the extensive buffet breakfast was a perfect way to start the morning.

"Let me just start by saying my husband and I are world travelers and traveled to a lot of places and always stayed luxury hotels but this one was really above everything we had experienced!!!   the superb service, attention to details and quality of food at both indian and Chinese restaurants are just few features of this great place.   we stayed there for two nights and then were off to Agra for one night and back again and they offered to store our luggages(at no cost) which was so helpful.  We had our first dinner at their indian restaurant and Arnav was extremely attentive and helpful and when at the end of our dinner I asked him about the tea I had, he came back with a beautiful bag of tea leaves that he had prepared for me to take home!!!

"We stayed two nights at the Oberoi at the start of our 15 day tour of Delhi, Agra and Rajasthan. It was a haven of  tranquility in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Delhi.  The hotel is understated and elegant but what really sets it apart from other hotels is the attention to detail and the superb service.   We ate at the Indian restaurant Omya on our first evening. The staff were very knowledgeable and took time to explain each dish making suggestions, offering advice and even bringing us different types of breads which they knew would be better with our chosen dishes.

We had 4 nights here and it was fabulous. Everything was 5 star....the service....the rooms and the facilities. All perfect. The staff were so helpful and friendly.....a special mention for Shlok in 360 who was charming and a great waiter and Harsh in the Club Bar who was also charming and a great asset to the Oberoi.  Unfortunately we have been spoiled by the experience and the hotels we have stayed in since seem very mediocre.  I was sick one night after eating outside of the hotel and the restaurant manager at 360 was so helpful in the morning when they noticed I was not eating.

"This hotel deserves a five-star status and for me, the moment I was picked up at the airport reflected the level of dedication to quality and ensuring a “Wow” factor.    Arrival to hotel: My flight arrived from the US in the late evening hours.  Exhausted as I was, the hotel reached out to me (via the chauffeur) while in transit to the hotel asking if I needed anything from the kitchen, or perhaps a pillow type to aid in my need of sleep.   Greeting at the hotel was pleasant; a bellman immediately whisked my luggage away as I was presented with a beautiful lei.  A hotel representative accompanied me to my room and demonstrated all the features and explained the amenities.  The hotel was gracious enough to upgrade me which certainly made my stay that much more comforting.   …",Date of stay: October 2018,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for your words of appreciation and encouragement.

We were greeted at the airport by a chauffeur drive luxury car, on arrival greeted by the manager and taken to our room to be introduced to our butler. The rooms were modern, beautiful and comfortable. The food is excellent. We had two amazing dinners at the terrific Baoshuan rooftop Chinese restaurant. They also have a great cafe on the lower levels serving coffee, snacks and desserts. I had the best haircut in my life at the hair salon downstairs!

"Nowhere else the saying “guest is God” is as true as to when one is staying at the Oberoi.  Two weeks ago me, my wife and my in-laws had the most amazing experience when staying in three different Oberoi properties (Delhi, Agra and Udaipur).   This review is directed to Oberoi Delhi but because of Oberoi’s similar standards across properties, there will be a big overlap with my review for Oberoi Agra and Oberoi Udaipur.   But without further ado, let’s roll this one out.   Before I get into details I must warn you that through the Oberoi website we bought a package called “Exotic vacations”, which means that we were entitled to a few perks.

"This was our 1st trip to India, and the first time we stayed at Oberoi hotels.  All we can say is WOW.  Just had the best experience.  Oberoi New Delhi was outstanding, just as all the Oberoi hotels we stayed at in Mumbai, Jaipur, Agra, Undipur and Gurgaon.  Having stayed at many different hotels all over the world, we have never experienced service, and the happiness that comes with that service, as we experienced across these Oberoi hotels.  India is an amazing place, and when you can combine the natural beauty, at times challenging touring, wonderful food, beautiful people, having hotels like the Oberoi hotels to be a little oasis to come home to each night was a real treat.  Thankyou.  The best ever holiday.",Date of stay: September 2018,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for your words of appreciation and encouragement.

"When the TOND reopened I was really excited. Finally, I got a chance to stay at this hotel. The hotel is indeed beautiful. Sadly, It doesn't match the level of The Oberoi Gurgaon in the terms of design and beautification but it is all shadowed by the Oberoi Services. They've put all their effort into making this property a heaven for the guests. I really appreciate the hardwork and care put in by the employees of the hotel. The only issue I faced was, Housekeeping desk took very long to answer my calls. I could literally listen to my calls being forwarded to different numbers and it took a few minutes before someone answered the call. I will ignore this as it is a very small issue and is overshadowed by the spectacular services provided.",Date of stay: February 2018,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,   It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi on your recent visit.

"My husband, daughter and I stayed at the Oberoi for three nights at the end of August before we left India for the US. We had spent eight days in Chandigarh before that. Our first impression was of how lovely it was. There are many charming details, especially a unique sculptural screen with the theme of hospitality in the lobby. The staff of the hotel work as a team and I was very impressed that they discourage individual tipping but rather split tips up amongst all. Our room was very comfortable, excellent bedding and soft bed. The internet was fast which allowed my husband to continue his work at home.

"What distinguishes Oberoi from other brands of luxury hotels is the amicable hospitality. The bonhomie exuding from the staff (I must specially mention the name of Khushbu Rawat here) has won me over. Right from the entering the hotel,the check-in, getting pampered with a beautiful bouquet of red roses and a delicious cake (as the day happened to be my birthday) to making me and my friend comfortable, everything levelled to perfection. To add to the home-like atmosphere, the I-pad technology - to know who is at the door and to open it from your bed, controlling the curtains and the lights and not to forget the rarely seen remote-controlled mirror TV in the bathroom.

"Let me start by mentioning, as we all know, the air quality in India is not the best.  That said, the Oberoi New Delhi decided to do something about it by installing a state of the art air filtration system;  something you won't know how much you appreciate until you actually leave the complex.  Our visit is predicated by medical necessity so the air, food, and a stress free environment are paramount.  The Oberoi exhibits top tier in all three.

We stayed as a family of 3 for two nights in August in a double premier plus room.  Would recommend going for the plus as you then have access to the residents club for pre-dinner drinks and canapes. The hotel looks a little dated architecture-wise but this actually adds to the charm and the hotel has just completed a two year renovation newly opening in 2018 and so inside everything is brand new and it’s fabulous. The room was superb and the service second to none. We had a couple of hiccups and what sets apart a good hotel from a great hotel is how these were dealt with and in our case it felt like every member of staff had been personally traumatized by the issues and were so warm and friendly that we almost felt humbled that we’d raised the issues as they weren’t really that…,Date of stay: August 2018,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,   I am delighted you had a memorable experience with us and we were able to exceed your expectations.

"Have not stayed in a better hotel.  While not on the beach in Hawaii, for a city hotel, I have not experienced better.  The service is incredible with beautiful rooms.  Delhi is a mostly low lying city and so staying up a few floors in this hotel affords excellent views.  Delhi is also spread out, and so nothing is really walk-able form this hotel, but you can easily hail Uber and I did take an Auto Rickshaw back to the front entrance.

We have been travelling around India for nearly 3 weeks and stayed at the best hotels in each city.  However the Oberoi has been the best by far and been the hotel we have extended our stay in to relax at the end of our travels.  The cleanliness of the hotel and rooms are fantastic. The rooms are newly renovated with everything linked through an iPad so the kids were happy.  But by far the best attributes are the staff and the service. Everywhere else we went it was hard to find any decent level of staff and service but somehow here they have amazingly nice and helpful staff with nothing too much trouble.

"As a five star hotel you expect cleanliness, quality food and good service.  The staff of Oberoi take it beyond.  From the moment you arrive to the day you depart the staff is attentive,  recognize and call you by name upon site AND up sell services as if it were a nothing but the norm. Restraint chef’s greet customers daily, make small talk and offer any special menu adjustments if needed.  Cleaning staff in rooms are attentive to the smallest detail.  They politely offered a book mark beside my book (embarrassingly i was using an airplane napkin)...also replaced a charger cord as the one i was traveling with appeared to be worn slightly.

"My partner and I booked a ten night Luxury Escapes package that included four Oberoi properties in Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Gurgaon. Our first was the Oberoi New Delhi for three nights.  This was our first time to India, so we weren’t really too sure what to expect - complete novices. On arrival at the airport we were expecting chaos but thankfully, it was less mad than imagined. As soon as we left the doors after customs/immigration we saw a smiling face with our details on an Oberoi sign - which was easy to spot in the slightly small late night crowd.

"Recently stayed at the Oberon in Delhi.  It was a fabulous hotel l, spacious rooms and the staff were very friendly and attentive.  I was travelling with a female colleague and we wanted to do a side trip to the Taj Mahal.  The staff were amazing and wanted to make sure that we were well looked after and safe as two women travelling alone - we had a private car and also were able to use the facilities at the Oberoi at the Taj (another great hotel where we had lunch).

This is a hotel which all others can aspire to. Finally I have found a hotel that knows how to treat its guests and one that makes you feel truly at home.   From the moment the door of my limousine was opened the genuine smiles and warmth of the concierge was appreciated. You will not experience such a warm greeting from anyone but your best friend. Every door is opened. Every elevator button is pushed. You are the most important person in the world.  When you reach your room you are cocooned in the most lavish appointments.

"We spent 2.5 nights at the newly renovated Oberoi, New Delhi, on the 7th and 8th floors that had expansive views over the golf course/forested land - the skyline of Delhi was a misty (pollution) hint in the background. We were completely happy with our very restful experience. Most importantly, the staff are fantastically courteous, we can't say enough about their sweet and sincere manners. Their uniformed appearance is also spectacular. Second, although from the outside this Oberoi structure appears like a city block building, the property is a highly pleasant oasis as soon as you enter the gates - beautifully appointed throughout with a delicate lattice effect.

Quality of services depends on the friendliness of the staffs and I should say they are really really friendly and caring. I was down with flue during my stay (for 2 days) and the staffs offered me medicine and hot herbal drinks always. Interesting part was when I offered tips for the guy who kept my room he didn’t take it at all.

"We stayed at the Oberoi last week for a business trip.  Our trip was marred by little incidents that were entirely our fault, unrelated to the hotel, and yet from start to finish the hotel staff went above and beyond in professionalism and care.

"Brilliant. That is the only word to describe this place. Recently renovated, the rooms are smaller than I would have expected for the price, but lavishly appointed. Definitely the highlight is the service. I have stayed at many other wonderful hotels but this one is superior to them all. If you want yo feel incredibly special, stay here. The views from the room is good not like many other 5 star hotels where windows open in front of garbage yards.  The staff in the restaurant is very polite and service was prompt.

"We were lucky to be upgraded to a lovely suite overlooking the pool on the 5th floor. We received the ‘Oberoi welcome’ beautiful chocolate plate. The room was modern, clean, with a progressive iPad driven features eg. room service, movies, lighting, blinds and even the ability to see who was at the door. The rooftop bar and restaurant lived up to expectation, with excellent service, food and drinks (except we ate too many of the freely flowing bar snacks!). Having experienced five of the Oberoi properties, the one small difference in Delhi was the lack of interest by the staff that we found in the other hotels. They were polite and helpful but just not quite the same. In Delhi, you felt you were just another guest passing through - unlike elsewhere. Highly recommend nonetheless.

"I knew this hotel very well, in its old golden days. It's the first time I visited after renovation- they have done a brilliant job in upgrading the hotel, though I loved the old one as well.  The USP of Oberoi is always it's hospitality, if one wants to experience the prime of it, then Oberoi it is. Our three nights here was just excusite and memorable.  We used the health club, which is nicely equipped, enjoyed the outdoor and indoor chill pool, breakfast was just amazing.

"Whenever we are in Delhi we always stay at the Leela Palace  as their rooms are posh and the service exceptional. We’re regular guests of the Oberoi and prefer it over Taj any day. We have celebrated our anniversary at the Oberoi Wildflower Shimla regularly. We have also stayed at Raj Vilas, Vanya Vilas, Mumbai , Kolkata etc. the service is indeed excellent and warmth unmatched.   This time when we were in Delhi we decided to skip the favourite Leela and check out the newly renovated Oberoi. It was the best decision. Now unlike other hotels, the Oberoi has no rewards program as such. BUT... the minute you walk in they already know that you’re a returning Oberoi guest.

"The Oberoi was indeed first-rate and made my trip!  First, there's a certain lavishness to the hotel that's aesthetically tasteful.  The rooms include all the small touches from organic teas to butler service.  The staff is exceedingly attentive, friendly and helpful.  The restaurants are excellent.

"We recently stayed at this hotel while passing through Delhi. Look no further: in a country of great hotels, the Oberoi is an exceptional chain, and the newly renovated Oberoi Delhi is the jewel in the crown. It is a wonderful hotel: great location, beautiful building, gorgeous rooms (we had one over-looking the Humayan tomb) and above all the most gracious and helpful staff imaginable.

"I stayed at the Oberoi New Delhi for 2 nights. I was blown away by their levels of service. I was always greeted by name, staff knew my preferences without me having to repeat them.  All the restaurants are excellent.  Whenever I asked if they could help me source a specific tea to take home, or jasmine essence that they use in the hotel they would find them for me and have them sent to my room.  I used the spa which was excellent and the facilities five star. a welcome outdoor pool in the heat of may.

I visited the place along with my wife and stayed here for a day. The recently renovated property is the best place to stay in Delhi. We were warmly greeted at the front desk.

"I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights 5 days in mid April 2018. It reopened after renovation in Jan'18.  The staff are extremely courteous and thoughtful. Special thanks to Amit for arranging chocolate cookies when i mentioned that i loved them and housekeeping staff Raman - she is adorable and really helpful. The rooms and even suites are still smaller in size and dont give the feeling of being spacious. The walkin closet has no cupboards which for me was a little unusual. The hotel has the latest amenities with ipad operated room/service automation - which was great. Something should be done about the same daily buffet breakfast. the indoor temperature regulated pool, spa, sauna gym facilities are great - used the pool on all 3 days.

If I may take a moment and explain the art installation in the lobby. The lobby of The Oberoi, New Delhi is graced by a welcoming new addition – a floor- to- ceiling art installation. Aptly titled Atithi (translated as Guest in Hindi), the screen is a metaphorical interpretation of time and gracious hospitality. Atithi also translates literally, as that which occurs without a known time or date, hence the installation offers a fitting tribute to the spirit of hospitality and the Oberoi service philosophy where a guest is always welcome irrespective of the time of arrival. This art installation also serves a dual purpose that of acting as a screen, which separates the Reception area of the lobby from the main lobby entrance. Hence, the screen accords resident guests an ensconced space in order to complete their check in or check out formalities without having to encounter the hustle and bustle of a throbbing hotel.  Whilst all our rooms are extremely well appointed and comfortable, I have taken a careful note of your comments. If I may explain room configurations at our hotel. We have been able to create two distinct room categories– the standard rooms of size 350 square feet and the much larger premier rooms of size of 550 square feet. We also have four different types of suites, Oberoi suite of size 725 square feet, Deluxe suite of size 1400 square feet, Luxury suite of size 1800 square feet, and Kohinoor suite of size 3500 square feet. Wardrobe size increases with the room size, we do provide portable storage space for guest who are travelling extra heavy. We have spent a considerable amount of time and money in upgrading our rooms and facilities, the comfort of our guests being our sole focus. Should your travel bring you back to Delhi, I will be happy to personally make all arrangements.  We look forward to welcoming you back.

On being shown to our room (beautiful room and an even more gorgeous bathroom!) we were handed 2 glasses of champagne . Awaiting us in the bedroom also was a delicious chocolate cake and an arrangement of 40 roses. This was just one of the ways the Oberon made our celebration special - when we returned to our room after dinner the first night we found the bath filled with rose petals and a work of art on the bed in the shape of swans etc.  The following morning at breakfast we met the beautiful Mona who congratulated us on our wedding anniversary and  with whom we had a…,Date of stay: March 2018,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  I am delighted you had a memorable stay with us and we were able to exceed your expectations.

I take this opportunity to thank you for your time in evaluating our product and services.  We have consciously tried to retain the essence of The Oberoi, New Delhi while designing all areas of the hotel and in most common areas, we have intentionally tried to retain a sense of familiarity given the long association of our guests with the hotel. The interiors of the hotel are inspired by Sir Edwin Lutyens’ Architecture with elements of traditional Indian Architecture. We have specially focused on The Oberoi design philosophy of “Height, Light and Space”.  We have spent considerable resources on changes which are not visible but contribute immensely towards the safety and security of our guests. The building structure has been strengthened through complex engineering technology, Best in class Air purification technology has been used to provide clean air for our guests. Modern and energy efficient equipment has been used to reduce our energy consumption. We have also increased the size of our rooms and suites significantly and introduced large picture windows to bring in more natural light.  It has been our endeavor to retain the sense of understated luxury that The Oberoi group is known for. Having said that, sense of aesthetics is different for different people, what is pretty for one, is ugly for another. With that I most humbly take your feedback on board, however, should your travel bring you back to Delhi, I will be happy to personally take you through the changes made to the hotel.

"Stayed a few times this year post the renovation.  1.  I came in winter and the heater in the room was not working, only the cooling function was functioning. I was told that the only option to warm the room was to switch off the AC!   2.A couple of times the reservation team misplaced my reservation or made me sign another persons reservation form.    3. Breakfast at 360 Please find attached photo of the dirty napkin, I asked one of the helpers to change the napkin, he said yes but just walked away. Needless to say he didn’t change the napkin.

"Since it was the first flagship I’d known to be shut for a 2 year renovation and reopened in January, I was excited. The lobby looked rich but generic. The live music in the evenings was good and took requests.  The check-in was quick.  The club room was big and luxurious, with a fantastic A/C. It even had an updated ITC Grand Chola Madras’s iPad controlled room. The USB port at the bedside was a great touch.  The bathroom matched up. The retractable bum-shower seemed trendsetting. Though it didn’t have a rain-shower, the shower was excellent. The Forest Essentials products smelt fresh. The two washbasins were a great addition.

"We've stayed at a lot of Oberois over a few years. Our favourite was the one at Udaipur, voted one of the best hotels in the world by Conde Nast readers. This Oberoi has just re-opened after a makeover. We can compare it to the ones down town in Mombai, and Dubai. You'd say these Oberois aren't as great for a leisure traveller as the Villas collection, which are usually out of town.  However this new re-awakening is a triumph. Service is beyond great.  I could bore you with how they go beyond the normal expectations. But I won't. It was our wedding anniversary when we stayed, and service went into overdrive when they found out. Generous to a fault.

"Arrived here after an overnight flight. It was very security conscious (in a reassuring way) so all bags were x-rayed (I don't think this was just because the President of France was in residence as it happened other Oberois). The welcome was lovely with the spot on the forehead for health and a garland of marigolds. The registration formalities were efficient and the room controls explained (really simple everything controlled from the iPad). Everything is safe, the water and food are clean so you don't have to spend worrying about basic issues - you could even clean your teeth with tap water (but they provide bottled water in case you find that hard to believe).

Traveling through 4 cities, we never touched our bags, Oberoi delivered them to the car, to the airport, to the hotel, to the room and then again to the next city and the next. There was someone to meet us at the airports, someone to pick up our luggage and someone to take us to a waiting Oberoi car. Fantastic and amazing. In 30 years of luxury travel, nothing comes close to Oberoi. And then the gods sent us Mona, who took time off to show us an exclusive part of the city.

"The newly reopened Oberoi is elegant and tastefully decorated.  But most of the 5-star hotels are also beautiful (though some are more ""garish"" than others).  What makes the Oberoi special and stands out from the competition are two qualities:   best breathable air, slightly scented, and over the top service. We recently stayed there for 1.5 nights (checked out for early morning flight) at the end of our two week visit to India.  We caught  colds from the cold morning tiger safaris, so were already suffering respiratory congestion exacerbated by all the dusty places we'd visited.

We missed the old shopping arcade that used to house many interesting shoplets including a great book store which is now gone, sadly!   The room we had was definitely brighter than before and fortunately with the same comfy bed and pillows. The bathroom seems tighter perhaps due to the separate cubicles for the shower and wc, the latter of which is way too cramp. Its quite a tight space when two people have have to use it at once.

"We stayed here for our final two nights on our tour of India.  Recently reopened, it has high tech gadgetry and beautiful rooms throughout.  Lots of electronic controls for lights and shades.  An iPad to order room service, control devices, or call for your personal butler.  Service is impeccable.  Everyone is anxious to help.  We stayed two days before the Republic Day Parade, so there were lots of Asian dignitaries and diplomats here.  But we didn't feel oppressed by the security, nor were we treated like second class citizens.   The rooms are large, and the bathrooms are opulent. We tried two of the restaurants, and they served good food (although the Chinese restaurant on the top floor is expensive).

"TheIconReturns. This has been the hastag that the Oberoi hotels has been using for re-opening of the hotel this January. So I had high expectations when I set foot in during my recent stay! To be honest just before it shut 2 years ago, the hotel was ageing. Old-school rooms, bathrooms with shower inside the bathtub, bits of wear and tear.

I usually stay at the Taj Mahal in Delhi but they were booked out so I thought I'd give the Oberoi a go. This is a top end property with all the bells and whistles and graceful service one expects from a high level Asian Hotel. My only quibble is that I found the gym and in particular the steam room and sauna a bit small and limited. For hard core business travelers like myself the exercise facilities are often the third most important consideration after price and location so this was a disappointment.

Our two night stay was planned at the last minute due to a very unpleasant experience at what was suppose to be one of the top spa's in the world, should have chosen an Oberoi hotel instead.

At our recent stay (10 days) I could not fault any aspect of the place; the service is far beyond any European or American establishments, the quality and specifications of the rooms is superb with outstanding housekeeping and a personal butler service. The food? Quite incredible, some of the best Indian food I've ever had, they also do more 'international' cuisine and sushi, and have a separate Italian restaurant which was equally as impressive.

"We visted several of the Oberoi on our trip to India. This one was the most typical hotel with nothing fancy to watch.

"We had a wonderful stay at the Oberoi recently. Nothing was too much to ask the wonderful staff. The breakfast was fantastic, as is the Sunday brunch. We ate lunch in the restaurant one day and had a wonderful curry. It's not cheap but you really do get what you pay for. I would recommend taking the hotel car transfer from the airport - the in car wifi and chilled water is bliss after a long journey. Otherwise, Delhi taxis will do you fine. The hotel car is rather expensive.  Lovely toiletries and unlimited free bottled water. Housekeeping tie your electrical cables up with Velcro to keep things tidy.

This is a remarkable hotel located at an incredible location with spectacular views.

"We spent an amazing few days here at the end of a delightful tour of India, and the Oberoi group as usual provided a fantastic send off. This grande dame is up for renovation and it will only serve to make the experience that much more perfect: smallish rooms and baths will give way to more spacious environments, and that might be our only critique of the spaces. However, service cannot be improved upon. Small delights: Anoyuksha went out of her way to find me a few English books to read since I had read those I brought along, and Mona Pancholi Singh delivered an amazing Indian Cookbook that I already am enjoying and reminiscing about food delights across the country.

Excellent service from staff and wonderful hotel to return to after exploring Delhi.  The hotel is closing in April for 2 years so perhaps look to ITC as a backup.

Our room was well appointed in a slightly old-world solid style, along a wide quiet corridor, with a good bathroom (nice organic toiletries) and a very comfortable bed.

"Since the moment I wrote them to ask some questions about Delhi, they were extremely nice and fast to respond. You knew why it´s been considered one of the best hotels in the city.   The property itself it´s very nice, 60s modern look. If you are looking to stay in an old palace this is not the place for you. It´s not as luxurious as other hotels but the location is great. Everything that we went were close - Delhi is huge so that was a plus.   The rooms are very nice, bathrooms too. Maybe a little dated yes, but everything works perfectly.   The breakfast was delicious. The chef was always around talking to guests and prepare a special Indian breakfast for us and delivered it to our table personally. Outstanding!

"This oberoi might not be as spectacular to look at as the other oberois on our recent trip to India. However, it was the best appointed. We had a suite overlooking parklands around the site of humayun's tomb - very private and peaceful. There were welcoming wine, a plate of fruit and chocolates, as was the case with all our subsequent oberoi hotels, however, this was the only one which gave us litre-bottles of water. Yes, this was important as, with our fragile first-world stomachs, we were warned to brush our teeth with bottled water to avoid getting sick, so lots were used and drunk. There was free internet access to boot. We were indebted to the young waiter who served us dinner on our first night and breakfast the next morning.

We've never been to a hotel where within the first day, staff greeted us by our names, and this happened several times in the main restaurant.  We remember the suggestions made by several of the servers and also people in the lounge regarding what was delicious to eat.  We tried their recommendations and experienced facets of Indian cuisine that we never had before.

"Our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children) had booked a standard room through the hotel's website for a pretty decent holiday rate. When we tried to confirm and later change our dates, we received conflicting emails from the central reservations staff and even incorrect information. The staff also never provided updated rate information (or never mentioned the rate would change once I removed one night of our stay from the original reservation), so I was surprised to see the rate we were actually paying once we got the hotel. The duty manager apologized for the problem with central reservations and allowed us to stay in our room until our night flight rather than having to check out at 5pm as originally booked.

"I stayed at the Oberoi for 3 nights in late December.  The hotel is of a high quality but what sets it aside from other hotels is the high level of customer service you receive from each individual member of staff.  Chanag, the Concierge, made our life so much easier by organising our train tickets to Jaipur and Agra, taxis and restaurant reservations.  He went out of his way to be helpful and this is a consistent theme for the Oberoi employees.  We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast in the restaurant was absolutely superb and of a high quality.

I have made a careful note regarding the price of alcohol. If I may take a moment and explain. In India , alcohol in 5 star hotels is very heavily taxed. On top of the bottle price, transport charges and export charges, we incur taxes in procuring them and then there is service tax and value added tax which adds to the cost.

A good business hotel. Maybe less so for a family trip despite the pool etc.    Rooms of a good size and quality with excellent service throughout.  Food while looking refined was rather bland and unexciting. Breakfast maybe better than dinner but both rather unexciting. Maybe they deliberately keep it bland for an international palate but for me it was the least exiting food of the many hotels I stayed in on a recent trip. An easy area to improve on.

Our Dharma and singular goal is to create guest delight, if the guest leaves unhappy we have failed to live up to the goal we have set for ourselves. As a company we always place our guests first hence we try to be extremely flexible with all guest requests, keeping in mind that they comply with the necessary policies and the government laws.    We did receive your request to accommodate three guests in a room.  Although we believe that accommodating three guests in a room means compromising guest’s comfort and feeling of luxury, the team empathized and the request was entertained as an exception.     Like many fine dining restaurants, Travertino also follows certain guidelines. In this case again, on receiving your request the team displayed flexibility in accommodating a 3 year old child and we did all we could to ensure your family had a memorable dining experience.    As mentioned by you, the Delhi State Law prohibits the admission and service of alcohol to guests below the age of 25 years in the bar. We did comply with it, however three sixty lounge was offered as an alternative to have coffee. In a banquet function, at times it is possible for someone to pick up a glass and then pass it on to someone else, however as soon as this was noticed the host was informed immediately, the service of alcohol was stopped altogether and a dedicated person was placed at the venue to ensure compliance. The legal consequences of allowing guests below the age of 25 in a bar are severe in Delhi.

I cannot say enough good things about the service, especially for breakfast, where the longest-serving staff member in the restaurant, Mr. Gautam, took such excellent care of us.  When he disapproved of our choices from the buffet, he sent over another breakfast (on the house), and then came over and showed us how to eat it, which condiments went with what, while buttering the parathas himself.

I stayed here during the same time as the Prime Minister of Australia. Instead of the hotel being frantic it was a joy and privilege to see such a well trained staff kick into gear.  Kudos to the GM.  On another note arrived early in the morning around 6am from Istanbul.  Once I was settled in my room did I hear a knock at the door with a butler who brought me some tea and a croissant thinking I would be hungry after such a long journey.

"I've stayed in many of the big hotels in Delhi on work trips. I wanted to give Oberoi a chance as I enjoyed the one in Mumbai & Shimla so much.  When I first checked in I got put into the worst room on level 1 and the view blocked by a building. The room had insects and the two lame flowers were old, it had clearly not been refreshed.   After complaining I got placed on the seventh floor. Better view but old room. This is the worst of the Oberoi hotels. I would not recommend staying here until it gets refurbished, which it will need to if it wishes to keep up with the others (Taj, ITC, Shangri la).

"The Oberoi Delhi is up there with some of the best hotels I have stayed in across the globe.  The staff are friendly, smile, welcoming.....everything you could ever want.  You feel welcomed from the moment you step in the door.  The rooms are nice, try to request one that faces the golf course on a higher level, and are well appointed.  Each room has a butler allocated for any of your needs.  The bathrooms are small but well appointed, shower over the bath being my only pet hate, and the A/C is great.  Could provide free email access for guest rather than slug a fee given the amount you are spending but that also is just an aside.   3 great placed to choose from the eat and a very nice and well appointed lounge.

"Stayed for 2 nights (paid for 3 nights to guarantee a 9am check-in following 24 hours of air travel).  We were picked up promptly at the airport and taken to the hotel, which was beautiful throughout.  The room was spacious with nice amenities.  The hotel breakfast was excellent, with many offerings of local Indian food as well as a great selection of western foods.  The fruit selection was excellent.  Also used the gym which was not huge, but had adequate selection of cardio and weight equipment.

"The Oberoi is a wonderful place to stay in New Delhi. It is conveniently located but at the same time tucked away next to the golf course, so it is surrounded by greenery and is very quiet. The hotel itself is very impresiive and our room was extremely comfortable. The hotel will close for next year for renovation, so it should be truly spectacular following that. I haven't mentioned the hotel's best feature however - its staff. The service we received was fabulous, genuine and warm.

However the moment you enter the bedrooms you feel you aren't in an Oberoi. Rooms are nice enough and as always very comfy but also very dated with old dark furniture and even older bathrooms.

Communual areas are very clean modern and fresh, Pool was excellent and the Spa was great , one of the best massages Ive had. Used the business centre for a few emails which was easy. We had cosmos in the bar both nights which were the best in India, well done. We ate in the Italian, as we had been in India for 2 weeks and needed a change. Food and Wine was quite expensive our bill for two came to £250.00  The only negative , I would not choose  was that the rooms did not reflect the rest of the hotel.

"Fantastic service all round. From the check in to room orientation to breakfast to room service to the guys at the main entrance.... Each human interaction with a smile and a conscious genuine attempt to help and resolve.  The check in process is quite unique with formalities like card deposit, ppt copies, etc actually done in the room.I am not quite sure what I would do to improve the hotel to get an excellent rating...

This is a very comfortable hotel with all the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel from the Oberoi brand.  The rooms are a little dated in style and our bathroom was pretty cramped despite the whole rest of the room being enormous.  We had arranged for the hotel to pick us up from the airport and for a full day guide and driver and this was arranged flawlessly and was very efficient.

"Stayed just for one day at the hotel in my last business trip to India, and all in all, the hotel is very good.  I stayed here the same week I travelled to Mumbai and stayed at the Oberoi there, and is impossible not to compare....and in this sense, the one in Delhi is a bit dated. Furniture in the room with some scratches and in one window of my room a piece of wood was missing.  However, this are really minor details in the context of a great service, friendly staff, very clean, spacious and nice room, good location.  Keeps the Oberoi standard in terms of service, and attention to detail.  As a client, you feel that the staff really cares about you.

We arranged a car through the hotel and our driver (Didar from Avis) was with us throughout the tour. He was excellent and a massive thank you to Didar. We always felt safe with his driving and he's so professional. We had two days in Delhi anthe excellent Mona arranged a tour guide for us.  I was very glad we did use a guide as Ashram was so informative and Delhi can be quite daunting if you do it alone!

"The Oberoi is not a cool hotel, as measured by youthful metrics. It is, however, a bit of a silver fox: this hotel's been around and has learned how to charm.  Staff found us a room for a stupidly early check-in (0700) and set about politely inquiring after our every need.   Food here is on the pricey side, perhaps because the Oberoi is a bit isolated: you're a few minutes by cab from interesting and/or comfortable Delhi neighbourhoods. If you do decide to dine in the hotel, you won't be disappointed.  The pool is lovely and the grounds very pleasant indeed.  Overall, The Oberoi is just a lovely experience.

The Oberoi Hotel stands apart for its legacy as well as regalia.Nowhere in the capital city can you walk into a foyer where you see sculptures of one of India's greatest sculptors Amarnath Sehgal.

And the flowers and the sunlight streaming in-everything is a touch of class and colonial niceties.If you are eating at the 360 restaurant get a table at the window and look at a large imposing statue by Amarnath Sehgal.This is vintage vitality and this is the beauty of timelessness.Only at the Oberoi.,Date of stay: September 2015,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your very kind feedback.

Excellent service throughout the hotel - staff very attentive but discrete when required. First class restaurant with excellent staff - very good food with wide choice however provided simple menu when asked.

"Family of five stayed in two rooms in August 2015.  The hotel and the rooms are a bit dated. Low ceilings in the foyer, rooms that are comfortable, but somewhat dated.  That said, the hotel earns top marks for exceptional service.  Frankly, the best service we’ve ever received and we’ve stayed at many Four Seasons and other five star properties.  Nothing was too much – every staff person remembered us instantly and went out of their way to assist.  The food here is terrific (and the restaurant itself more modern feeling than the rest of the hotel).  The breakfast buffet is enormous with food from around the world.

"This was my first solo trip (for the most part) ever and I was kind of nervous. I was meeting friends in the middle of the trip for a few days (part of a cancelled wedding group) but for the most part I was solo. So I was a bit nervous, being on my own in a foreign land and also because of what you hear on the news. I booked most of my trip with the Oberoi hotel group and let Ashneet B, who was helping organize my trip, of my fears. She promised that the hotel group would make it a memorable trip and boy, did they. I was upgraded to a suite at the Delhi hotel. And kept getting gifts, I couldn't believe it!

I have visited many hotels across the world and the service here in all areas is exceptional and ranks as the best I have ever come across.  However what lets the Oberoi down and hence the 4* is the old fashioned infrastructure - slow lifts that occasionally get stuck and rooms that although are very comfortable need upgrading to bring them into the 21st century.

"For our July - August 2015 trip to India, we got a chance to stay at The Oberoi, New Delhi twice. Both times, we were greeted by the amazing reception staff and impeccable service one can imagine. Inderpal Ji, Pooja, Nikhil, and many others made sure that our stay was memorable. The staff at the restaurants were superb. I agree with other reviewers about the dated rooms. The rooms especially the bathrooms need some updating. Not to forget, the butler service was icing on cake. I definitely recommend this property to everyone visiting India.

The hotel is also excellent with great restaurants.  Their buffet had so many choices that I must have gained a few pounds in a few days.  Mukesh one of the persons working there was extremely helpful in setting us up for a day trip to Agra to visit Taj.  Without asking, he prepared a boxed lunch and snacks.

Very nice hotel with very comfortable beds.  The rooms are a bit small but most still have a desk and couch.  The restaurants inside the hotel are fantastic and they have plenty of cars and drivers on hand for transportation.  The pools looked nice but didn't try them out at all.  Service was fantastic.

We got here and coming from other Oberois this seemed much inferior. After inquiring they told me that the hotel is about 50 years. It doesn't look like 50 years old but looks like the last major remodel of the rooms was the middle 90s. The bathroom was fairly small and the front desk was so receptive they went of there way to make us comfortable and changed us rooms. The breakfast buffet room and dining looks and feels much newer and modern and the food is delicious. No need to have dinner elsewhere.   I would recommend them to remodel the lobby and rooms by floor so that they can have the best rating in Delhi because the great service is their.

Throughout my stay, I was beneficiary to service par excellence. Kudos to Jay Rathore and his team for making this possible. One afternoon, Mohit, one of the hotel's housekeeping assistants knocked on my door, to present me with a gift - for my shoes. He said, 'sir i saw that you have expensive shoes. these are from my side to help you care for them'. The encounter left me embarrassed yet impressed.

"I've stayed in the Oberoi quite a few times over the years, and also in some other five star hotels in Delhi. The Oberoi is really perfect, they never make a mistake. This time I had some health problems (not related to my trip to India), and the staff were so kind and helpful, actually escorting me to a clinic for tests.   I also love the restaurants in the Oberoi. The 360 has a combination of different cuisines and somehow they manage to do all of them well.

But what amazed us were the people. We all know about Indian hospitality but the staff at Oberoi take it to another level. They did everything possible to make us feel at home like packing sandwiches for our drive around town, serving tender coconut water to rehydrate as soon as we got back to the hotel, checking on our kids to ensure they were having a good time.

We were less keen on the Italian restaurant .

We are a family of 4 with 2 young boys and this is our first time in India.  We have organised our trip through the Oberoi Vacation package visiting a number of Oberoi Hotels in India (an amazing service offered by Oberoi). I could not have possibly envisaged a better start to our vacation.  From the moment we were picked up at the airport we knew that this was going to be a special experience.  The people at the Oberoi makes this a hotel that stands head and shoulders above all others.  They anticipate every need before you even realise!

"The service at this place was incredible. They set up an opportunity for my colleague and me to watch an important US basketball game (our Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals!) Because the game was not airing on any channel in India, it was a very challenging thing for which they had to think outside the box and go well beyond normal service. Their can-do attitude made it happen--they paid for the rights, streamed it to a PC, and hooked it up to a big screen in one of the rooms. They even brought us a complementary breakfast spread for our game viewing party.  Also, the gym was pretty nice (not huge but plenty of free weights, treadmills and machines) but the service there was outstanding as well.

Essentially you need to spend a minimum of 7 days in at least two different Oberoi Hotels from a total of 11 throughout India and Dubai.

Check in very smooth and guests made to feel special.  Rooms are traditional English décor, old furniture but in good condition.  Staff very attentive.  Staff at the pool specially good, outside pool area very tranquil and well maintained.  Nice lounge bar and Chinese restaurant on tope floor is very good if a little pricey (by Indian standards).

On arrival we were welcomed from a long flight from London with flower garlands and some tea. We were sat down for check in and were made to feel completely at home. Our room was a suite, and the explanation provided on check in (including the 'butler' button! - which we grew to come accustomed to but never used!) was very detailed - almost too detailed (the safe sir is indicated with the word safe...) - but i'm not complaining, this was to be the start of some of the most fantastic service in the world at Oberoi hotels.

The Oberoi in Delhi is the perfect business hotel. It has an aristocratic charm to it. The location is also perfect.   In terms of decor & all being a Oberoi it is obviously great.

"Two recent trips lasting nearly a dozen days reminded me why the serene comforts of the Oberoi Hotel are worth the price (extremely pricey in the winter high season and very normal in Delhi's long, hot summer.

The rooms are impeccable, many overlooking the unexpected (if you don't know Delhi) green canopy of serene tree-cover, and very comfortable and elegant in a muted way.

The food was a little mixed.   The first night I had an excellently prepared sea bass for the main course, and a wonderful chocolate dessert.

After efficient and friendly checkin we settled into our very spacious and comfortable room.  The hotel although out of the centre is in lovely grounds with indoor and outdoor pools.

Access to the city is easy while offering a place to escape to when the city hustle and bustle gets to much  If you enjoy golf the a trip to the Royal Golf Course is a must  The hotel also offers and arranges tours to the historical parts of the city.  Agra is 2 hrs away and can be reached by private taxi.

"From the moment the driver picked us up at the New Delhi airport, I felt comfortable. We booked a businessman's special rate which included breakfast for two and Wi-Fi in the room as well as airport pick up and a 6 PM check out. It was well worth the price for all of these extras.  The treatment from the moment we met the driver until we checked out two days later was first class all the way. The room was not grandiose but more than large enough for 3 people  and it overlooked the water body, which I believe was a pool that is no longer in use. (there was also an indoor pool and another outdoor pool which was used).  The bathroom was gorgeous and the amenities provided were extensive.  Large bottles of water were complimentary and replenished as often as you wanted.

"This was my second trip to the Oberoi having stayed there seven years ago.  It had the incredible level of service that I remembered.  The staff could not possibly be more accommodating.  I was there for a week for a business meeting.  The staff and the food were excellent.  My first room was too close to the elevator so I asked to be moved which they didn't even balk at.  They checked on me later to ensure that I was happy with my new location.  If you stay here, do not miss the spa!  The treatments are wonderful.

I had a guest stayed at this hotel. She is a very simple lady and usually most hotels treat people who dressed down with caution. But not the Oberoi. They treated her like a Queen  Deepali from ThreeSixtydegrees derserved a special comment. Apparently she was very sweet to my guest and made sure that every morning for breakfast and a specific time her dinner is ready for her without being asked. This is customer service or what. Amazing job by this lady.  According to my guest everyone at this cafe was very pleasant to her as were those from the spa (i think she mentioned a lady from Darjeeling).   This is what I will label as treating all and any of your guest as if they own million dollars. The Oberoi has done it well and with Indian flavour and style.

"We were upgraded to this hotel while doing the 'Golden Triangle' tour of India, as the hotel we should have stayed at, the Maidens hotel, had over booked. It is an oasis of calm in the madness of Delhi. The staff were all charming, greeting us with garlands of marigolds. The waiters at breakfast brought us Indian food to try and the chef at dinner came to speak to us and offered us a selection of Indian desserts to try. The rooms are obviously for business travellers, so not over large but everything you need is there.

All the employees made you feel very welcome and made sure all you needed was provided. But at the same time, it was never a pushy service, where you feel like you cannot be left alone or that employees did things just to look for a tip. I provided a collective tip at the end of my stay, as it was difficult to point one out one employee that did things better than others. It was truely an amazing experience, and I doubt I will ever experience the same at another hotel.

Lovely hotel with excellent service. The room was good and I would suggest having a room on a higher floor. The restaurant served good food with plenty of choice for dinner and breakfast. The best part was the Patisserie where we had lunch on two days. Good choice of sweet and savoury items and reminded me of Patisserie Valerie at home. Very helpful when we wanted a car and driver. Good swimming pool area with comfortable sun beds and the attendant brought around complimentary cool fruit and drinks. The only annoyance was paying for wifi. A hotel of this standard should not be charging for this.

"The New Delhi Oberoi was our first hotel stop on our recent Oberoi tour of northern India. As with all four hotels, a 5-star rating system is inadequate to describe the exceptional service the Oberoi New Delhi provides!  It is unfortunate that this Oberoi does not get the accolades that its sister hotels enjoy.  Sure, being a city-based hotel,  it has a more commonplace hotel design,  rather than the singular extraordinary beauty of other Oberois.  Nevertheless,  there are several ways in which this hotel distinguishes itself from others.  For example, they have the best breakfast buffet of any of the Oberois where we stayed. My wife shared with me the Indian vegetarian breakfast that the chef prepared just for her one morning, and it was marvelous.

The service was superb and they pick you up from the hotel which is a real plus. The only gripe I have is that the hotel charges approximately 10GBP per day for Internet usage.

There is nothing here that says India aside from some design in the lobby, if that was removed this hotel could be in Chicago or Manchester. There are other hotels in New Delhi that are breathing down the neck of this venerable favorite and in time will eclipse it.

On our way from the airport, the hotel night manager called and asked if we wanted to put in an order for room service, the menu was in the car.  We were immediately taken to our room and checked in there, not made to stand at the front desk.  The concierge was terrific too, offering to help us organize a driver from Udaipur in case our flight to Delhi got cancelled.  He also made great recommendations for in town services that we needed.  We unwittingly left behind glasses and a scarf, which housekeeping shipped to us in the States.

"without even talking about the location, the restaurants, and the room amenities - the service that you get from the staff is truly world class.  Just upon check-in and with the first room service, you'll feel that you are being served and you can feel their sincerity.  Their concept of a personalized butler service is really something.  of course, I tried to do things myself on the first few days, until I get used to their hospitality and willingness to assist.  The staff really knows the meaning of ""customer service"".  I will always make sure that I will stay here on my next trip to Delhi.

"This hotel could easily become your standard. I confess that I was won over within seconds of entering, as an elegant woman (name?title?) swept us into her care and attended to our check in as we enjoyed tea. Any number of reviews will provide details, so this review will only gush. Nothing was wrong, or went wrong. If anything had disturbed us, I'm sure that a press of the ""butler"" button would have provided the remedy. Service is truly outstanding. The facility is outstanding. The location is outstanding.

"We stayed twice at the Oberoi, first for four nights on the 11th February and second on the 17th February for three nights. We felt that the hotel justified a 6 Star Rating. The reception that we received, the accommodation we were given, the breakfasts that we enjoyed, plus the incredible and genuine service that we received, plus the royal send-off that we were given when we left, all conspired to make our two stays memorable, for all the right reasons. We were impressed by the security and the two swimming pools, one inside and one outside, both heated added to the experience.

The staff knows your name and at breakfast the servers remembered by day 2 exactly what i liked and did not. It is luxury in every sense. Do not miss an appointment in the spa. No matter how hectic your travel schedule it, no matter how busy your work life is, it will be a nice break from reality. Excellent massages and excellent facials.

Since a lot of international flights do arrive late, the hotel staff keeps the chatting to a minimum and seems to understand the dazed look of its guests!

I also appreciate the lack of announcing aloud the room number.  I was escorted to my room immediately, completed paperwork in the room and within 3 minutes, I had my luggage and passport was returned.  Now to the physical appearance of the room----beautiful!

However, in all three we found the service outstanding. The staff were so friendly and nothing we asked for was considered impossible.

"We had 2 nights with our 2 small children at the end of our India trip at The Oberoi.  We had stayed in a mixture of hotels on our trip and were therefore a little disappointed by our room (and tiny bathroom - you literally couldn't swing a cat). We had booked a premium room and I expected a bit more space and a MUCH larger bathroom.  Having said that, everything else was perfect.  The greeting on arrival, being shown to our room, restaurant service, housekeeping, spa and pool staff.  All the staff were exceptional and I would stay there again (even with a small bathroom!) just to be looked after by the superb staff.

"The New Delhi Oberoi is located at convenient distance to many sites, restaurants, markets - all will require cabs that are always available at the door - and are metered (so no need to negotiate). The hotel is clean and rooms are very well appointed - not ultra modern but very nice. The service is outstanding. From the moment you register and for any needs you have, the staff will ensure you are looked after.   Friend of mine had a need for a dr for a minor issue and they quickly dispatched an onsite doctor direct to the room.

I also appreciated to no tipping policy with the opportunity to leave something in a tips box when leaving. Even this was low key and would suggest it is brought a bit more to the fore.

"First let me say that the Oberoi is the nicest hotel I've stayed in. The service was simply out of this world. For a nice example, when I was out and the room was being cleaned they organized my power cables for my iPad and phone by using little Velcro straps. I've always meant to do this, but never did it on my own so this was a welcome surprise.  After a 14 hour flight getting a massage at the spa was fantastic, easily the best massage I've ever had.  I will say that I chose this hotel in part because of its proximity to Humayun's tomb and the Lodhi gardens with the expectation that I could walk to them. This is certainly possible, but as this was my first trip to India, I did not expect slums to be so close to the hotel and these important monuments.",Date of stay: December 2014,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for your words of appreciation and encouragement.

"A truly memorable stay at the Oberoi in Delhi. We arranged with friends a trip to celebrate our joint 30th anniversaries and the start at the Oberoi was incredible. Our rooms were superb, the delivery of cake and flowers to celebrate was such a lovely touch. Mona in guest relations was a star. Nothing was too difficult to arrange. She arranged a car and driver ( the superb Gilbert) and she made a daily plan to include important sights, peddicab rides, markets, restaurants and good shopping. Each day on our return to the hotel, she checked with us to ensure we were happy and recommended the next day's plans. Car and driver cost about £75 a day from 9:30am until 10pm .

"The service lived up to its top-notch reputation from the moment I set foot in the hotel. It was a little busy as they were accommodating two weddings at the same time so they offered me tea or coffee in the Club Bar as I waited for them to process my check-in. They finished before my tea arrived so they offered instead to send it to my room.   Staff were very attentive and responsive throughout my stay. The hotel even has an IT expert who very kindly helped to fix connection problems on one of my devices.   The furnishing is a little dated but it does have a regal feel to it. The only drawback to this hotel is the fact that Internet is only offered for free for 30mins/day.

We stayed here 6 nights and used it as a base to see the sights of Delhi and Agra.  It was so nice to return here after sightseeing each day and let our overrun senses settle down.    We traveled with our 2 kids ages 8&11. They enjoyed the pool and the interconnecting bedrooms.  It gave us all the space we needed.    We had a room overlooking the park/golf course- also very serene.   the hotel can provide you with a guide and driver.  We had our own arranged through friends.  But that would be required if you have never been here before.  Driving is chaotic and I would never choose to do that here.    The restaurants were excellent.

The service from the hotel staff is nothing short of exceptional and the tiredness of the hotel quickly disappears once the staff have provided you with 1st class assistance. we ate at two of the three restaurants being the international restaurant and the chinese which is located at the top of the hotel with great views of the fog/smog outside!

But now it is again our home sweet home in Delhi—so comfortable and dependable and so well located within the city. We plan our visits at Christmas time, 1/2 way through our stay in India and it gives an opportunity to experience city life at a time of festivities and celebration.

However the guide that the Oberoi Delhi organized was not up to Standard. On our last day the guide told us that he did not receive payment from the Hotel and we still needed to pay him. Turned out he did receive payment from the Hotel and he tried to increase his tip that way. I expect that they also select their guides / contractors more carefully, even though they are not Hotel employees.   F&B Service including the cooking class was excellent - as was all other Service.

"From the moment you check into this hotel, it's very clear that their customer service is among the best in Delhi. While it may not have the most updated hotel in Delhi, the attention to detail is extraordinary. My wife and I were staying at the Oberoi to attend an Indian wedding reception and ceremony over two days. We asked Priya at the front desk whether she could help my wife put on her Indian sari. She sent Anoyuksha to our room to help with the sari, and Anoyuksha's attention to detail was invaluable. What we thought would take a local five minutes to do in fact took time and skill and my wife looked glamorous, thanks to Anoyuksha, who wouldn't accept a tip for her efforts.

"The Oberoi gives you a sense of old world charm through the classic style of the decor and marries this with a smiling, friendly service.  When staying in India if this is a foreign country to you (as it is to me despite several visits) then you want to know you are in India and not 'just another hotel'. The Oberoi gets this right with well chosen furnishings.  But a hotel is nothing without service and The Oberoi delivers perfectly. There is great attention to detail and attentiveness without being overtly fussy and interfering.

Having stayed at almost all the major and minor chain hotels across major cities in the world I can very safely say that TOND is one of THE best yet understated hotels for service quality.

"First of all, the service at the Oberoi is “off the hook” great!  Rarely does a hotel have everyone in the property trained in superior service but this hotel exceeds every expectation. Most notably, the 360 restaurant is awesome.  The food variety and quality is terrific but, on top of that, the service is a model of how to do it right.   Not only is the staff attentive, they anticipate needs and go out of their way to make sure you’re happy.  Importantly, traveling in India still has challenges with water cleanliness and food hygiene. The 360 restaurant prepares their food in the open and you can see the food handlers frequently washing their hands and wearing clean rubber gloves when handling food.

But the truly amazing thing about this place is its service.

Speciality foods were brought to the table, without our asking, so we could try something new.

"Since it was a 10 day business trip my days were out of the Hotel and meetings in the evenings from the Hotel room. From the moment I arrived at the airport and a Hotel car was waiting, to the personal way of checking me into my room and going over any details of my visit, all was handled with excellent care. During the check-in process we discovered I should consider extending 1/2 day check out due plane not leaving till near mid-night. There are three great restaurants and a lounge. Quality of food and service top notch, very friendly. They go beyond the menu, I was feeling congested towards the end of my stay and mentioned to the server at home I would make a pot of ginger tea, next thing I knew 20 minutes later, a pot of ginger tea.

By far one of the best hotels I have stayed. Very guest friendly and extremely courteous staff all around. Rooms are spacious and extremely clean and nice with everything in the room impeccably placed. Gives a very homely feeling. They really pamper you with their courteousness.   I would highly recommend a trip to the spa to unwind from a hectic day.  Ask for Nob who is an excellent masseuse and very pretty.    She will make you feel relaxed and at ease. Don't be surprised if you doze off when she massages your forehead.   The front office manager Pooja Bhondekar is very friendly and she will make sure your stay is very comfortable. I definitely plan to go back.   ,Date of stay: November 2014,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi on your recent visit.

We just asked the chef to prepare a mix of different things, and they just delivered.  Consider this is a 5-star hotel, the cost was very reasonable.

"Over the last 36 years or so, I have had the pleasure of staying at the Oberoi over a dozen times. On one occasion back in 1992, I stayed with my wife at the hotel for six months, while we were looking for a house in Delhi. What impressed me during my recent stay was the fact that two of the staff came up to me and greeted me and recalled my stay at the hotel more than 22 years ago. I am full of admiration for the elegance and the charm of the Oberoi, but I have always valued it most of all for its service.     Having stayed at well over a thousand hotels all over the world, I have no hesitation in saying that I would rate the Oberoi in New delhi, as one of the very best hotels I have stayed in, not simply in India, but in the world.",Date of stay: November 2014,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  I am delighted you had a memorable stay at The Oberoi, New Delhi.

I 'm writing after a week I was in Delhi ( for a months for business) and I still have in my mind that wonderful sensation: I was been in a huge family . The last week I was in Delhi I decide to spend time in Oberoi hotel because I needed to relax during a very hard period passed walking around fair and suppliers. My perspective is different from other persons. I don't care if the room is enough big for the amount I paid or about how large is the bathroom. I found a beautiful family taste and staff well trained in every situation . Always super kind . I never found an atmosphere like this ...and I traveled a lot .

"Like many first-time visitors to Delhi, I arrived at the hotel in the middle of the night, but was still warmly welcomed and immediately shown to a spotless, pleasant - albeit a little dated - room with a view over the pools. The staff were courteous and helpful throughout the trip.  Breakfasts were exquisite, and the servers went out of their way to introduce me to Indian dishes available on order. Three days, three different dosas! Dinner at the Chinese restaurant was ok, but as I come from a city noted for its Chinese cuisine, I did not find it in any way remarkable.  The hotel features a very large and well-laid out fitness room and spa, which would have stood me in better stead by the end of my trip, considering how much I ate on my travels.

"Let me be honest. I stayed here for the first time, I was disappointed, I gave them feedback, they responded ( a good 5 days after i left ) and only then I decided to write back  a review for TripAdvisor. Some of my issues were structural ( what can a 5 star hotel do if it  doesnt have a bidet spray in its bathroooms, now most of its target are'nt Indian)- so I forgive them. I was on a business trip so my key requirements were wifi, space for clothes and an efficient room service.The New Delhi property is an old property so not really a very well designed room for modern travellers.

"Stayed 5 nights on a business trip. Hotel is very nice for sure but the rooms are not the most modern when it comes to interiour and every surface is cluttered with different decorations, papers and stuff.   Hardly place for your book. Wifi is not included in the room rate and you have to renew the deal every 24h. View from my room was a big concrete roof and a road.   Breakfast room is very noisy and despite the amount of staff service can be slow. It took 15 minutes to get a coffee one day.   Spa is very nice but overpriced in my opinion.

"The Oberoi in New Delhi is not the most attractive building from the outside but a fabulous hotel once you step in through its front doors. The service in all areas of the hotel is second to none and with thoughtful extra touches all the way through, for example, the tray with cold water, chilled fruit and sun lotion the moment you arrive at the pool. The breakfast buffet is comprehensive but just in case, you are also offered an a la carte menu...the eggs Benedict are perfect. Of course all this comes at a price, but if compared to an equivalent standard UK hotel, its still reasonable.

So I very much looked forward to trying the Delhi property - and overall I give it a thumbs up!   The only negative for me was that the room seemed quite small after staying at the Gurgaon Oberoi (a very new property with very spacious and comfortable rooms), so when I first saw my room I was disappointed.

What a pleasure to find wonderful linens, good food, hot food brought to you in the morning; coffee from a butler, an indoor pool for laps and an outdoor one for whatever; all in the middle of Delhi.

Common complaint (and the only one!) was the TV in the bathroom being unviewable whilst you are actually in the bath. Oh well! Made the mistake of showing my wife a photo of the Gucci shop without bringing her a present from it.

"The Oberoi, New Delhi was the perfect place to stay on our first night, and on our last night in India.  The hotel is as expected for an accommodation of this caliber.  The staff was professional, friendly and super helpful, and most importantly, the two rooms we had were clean, and in working condition.  We did, however expected more from the layout and the decor of the room.  It is smaller than we expected, and the decor was a bit generic.  The Threesixty restaurant on the ground floor was pretty decent, and also provided excellent service.  One BIG negative for us is the extra charge for wifi.  Who does that these days?

"We arrived at Delhi airport from Chandigargh to find that my husband's case had not arrived. Whilst we were attempting to engage an official in the process of trying to locate it( with not much luck) a gentleman from the Oberoi appeared and took over the whole matter. We were whisked to the hotel in a luxurious car and welcomed warmly. Tarin, the concierge, assured us that he would contact the airport and resolve the matter. Check in was quickly and efficiently completed in our room and we went down for dinner in 360 degrees, one of the three restaurants in the hotel.

The check-in happened in my room with 3 attendants escorting me to my room - one for my bags, one with the check-in documents and another one introducing himself as the private butler.

"Beautiful hotel with excellent service. Rooms are standard like in any other same category hotel. Comfortable, clean and beautifully furnished. There are several different restaurants there. We had dinner in Italian restaurant. Service was excellent but food not so) My Jaan didn't enjoy his spagetti, so they were so much worried and caring about him not to stay hungry and unsatisfied)) Chef came with manager and they too much requested to change the dish and also they had small surprise in desert. I really appreciate like this care and attention from management to guest.  Every guest is special for them!  Hotel is located in the center of Delhi near to Delhi golf club.

This is a very corporate hotel   I mean there were peoe like crazy here. The hotel is pretty though.  Rooms: Initially they out my friend and I 2 girls in one king sized bed. I was like um ....

"Summary: A very poor experience at the end of an otherwise wonderful experience at other 4 other Oberoi properties.  Dated, poorly appointed and insufficiently staffed  - I assume this was one of the first Oberoi properties and, frankly, the entire brand is let down by this property.    Pros: The saving grace was the restaurant staff (and indeed the food) at Travertino  Cons: Charging for internet usage; the welcome and check-in, the check-out, the driver, the rooms  When I read a poor review of a prestige property I generally first check to see if the reviewer is a crack-pot and hence whether they are worth listening to?  (Getting upset about the unavailability of Coke zero vis-à-vis Diet Coke was one such clue.)  So whether I myself am a crack-pot or not, and jury is still out…",Date of stay: February 2014,bubble_20,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for reverting to my emails.

Perhaps only two small criticisms:  The free WiFi internet service provided was only for a period of 30 minutes per day - thereafter chargeable.

"All aspects of out two night stay were at a very high standard - Check in, management of our luggage, quality/menu/service of the meals, quality and facilities of the room, and efficient check-out.   From the outside the building looked a little grim, but this was utterly misleading, as the place was great in all respects. All staff were eager to please without being overbearing, and though there is a no-tipping policy for individuals, we happily left an envelope at the desk as we left.  The hotel was chosen for us by our tour company - Uniglobe - so I don't know what was paid for the room, but bearing in mind the cost of the tour, it must have been excellent value.

"We were visiting The Oberoi New Delhi as part of a trip of Northern India and this hotel has a perfect location for seeing the sights of New Delhi. The hotel has found a great way of managing the different expectations of those people staying on business and those visiting the city as part of a holiday and this started with a warm welcome when we arrived...and the same hospitality continued throughout our stay. Our room was modern and very comfortable (we had a Premier Room) and had a great view over New Delhi. Since we had arrived following an overnight flight, we spent time at the pool-side to relax following the journey and it was hard to believe that we were in a large city.

"We arrived at the Oberoi after an overnight flight from London and were greeted with a flower garland and a glass of sparkling wine while check in was sorted out by staff. A lovely, relaxing way to start our holiday - and it set the standard for our stay.  Nothing was too much trouble for the staff - each one of whom were charming.  Our room was extremely comfortable, with great views across the golf course and woods above which birds of prey swooped all day.  Breakfast buffet was a great spread of Indian, American and European cuisine, with a good range of a la carte options too.

Our meeting conference well catered for, and service very good.  Unfortunately I could not enjoy the fitness center or spa as I was just on a quick business trip.  It's hard, however, when you're used to being a platinum marriott member, to not have the same service level and catering to here at this hotel.  Late checkout is difficult to get, and an argument.

"We only had one evening at the Oberoi in Delhi but it was super comfortable and very luxurious.  I expect service so it is the little things that set a 5* hotel apart. Comfortable bed, soft, fluffy pillows, free water bottles are a huge plus, I hate however, having to pay for WiFi no matter what the class of the hotel. I feel it should be free. Other than that the hotel is top notch and i would like to mention the waiters in the bar area and the sommelier.

It's close to everything but just removed enough to always feel calm (the golf course out the back helps).  The public spaces are welcoming and grand without being ostentatious.  The bar is quiet and relaxed, the 360 restaurant always calm and the food is stunning (we were there for a menu from the Hyderabad region, the regional specialties change - try them!) and the clientele is a fascinating mix of tourists and locals, whether business people, family birthday dinners, engagement parties or holiday makers.

"This was our third stay at New Delhi Oberoi. We have used the hotel as jumping off point for tours of India. It is a predominately a business hotel but there is a fantastic Spa which my wife uses on her first day there to unwind from her plane journey.

The breakfast buffet was plentiful and there was a good ""a la carte"" breakfast menu.  We ate in the 360 restaurant, which has modern decor,  on both our evenings there and enjoyed the Indian food.

There were some problems with noise from construction and a late night wedding party but the management and staff were very responsive. We will stay there again on our next visit.",Date of stay: December 2013,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your very kind feedback.

"Stayed here the first of the year after returning from Jaipur.   Service is impeccable, from checking in, in the restaurants, and spa. Rooms were small, old world charm. Maybe due for some updating here and there. Internet works well although wish it was included. Butler was a nice way to start the stay with a glass of bubbly. Food plentiful! Buffets were great. Spa was small but lovely. My husband and I had mani/pedi (which he absolutely hates but actually enjoyed this one) and massages (also great). We also enjoyed the complimentary yoga classes in the am.  Overall, excellent stay. Wonderful service would highly recommend.",Date of stay: January 2014,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your very kind feedback.

"We arrived The Oberoi, New Delhi at 3:00 am and was met by a very cordial reception staff who took care of us and helped us get settled in. Since our niece, who was already at the hotel, had asked to be awakened upon our arrival, they accommodated her request and we got to see our niece at that ungodly hour. Go figure what 20 something kids think of these days. It was a very nice gesture on her part and got our trip off on the right foot.  The hotel was fabulous, the food was delicious.

"After a long 14-hour flight that arrived at 10 PM, this hotel offered just the right landing spot and soft introduction to our first time in India.  The hotel was splendid.  Our room was beautifully furnished and comfortable.  I had a great soak in the tub to wash off the airplane, then relaxed in the lovely bathrobe before getting ready for dinner.  At that late hour, the 360 Restaurant was the only one open.  At first we were little intrepid about ordering from the Indian side of the menu but with guidance from our very helpful servers (Rajat and Deepak), we made selections that were out of this world.

Evreyone from the room attendants to doormen to front desk agents to dining room staff and management bent over backwards to ensure everything was perfect! We ate in the Threesixty restaurant for breakfast every day and dinner on two occassions. On the first day we were eating breakfast when a waiter suddenly appeared with a plate of Indian breakfast specialty items for us to try.

Four Seasons, Mandarin-O, St Regis, etc), the rooms here are really rustic! Service is extremely professional and friendly, but when it fails, it could be extraordinary!

Everything was perfect - I had a nice view of the adjacent golf course, park and hotel pool from my room.  The service was excellent and personalised.

"A beautiful hotel with good service. Rooms are comfortable and overall ambiance very good. But the restaurants lack uniformity of standard. The roof top Chinese restaurant is one of the best we have found in the region, but the Italian restaurant is just the opposite. The service is slow and the quality of food awful. Our soup was cold when served and the steak was just defrosted meat. Trying to book a room in Kolkata Oberoi was quite an experience as their reservation system was not integrated enough.

"This is an awesome hotel. Stayed there as part of a conference of more than 50 people and nothing was too much for the staff. They get things done remarkably fast. Their buffet breakfast is one of the best I've seen not just in Delhi but in the many 5 star hotels I've visited. Staff-guest ratio is also excellent especially during breakfast. Very proactive management, when we arrived at the hotel to check in for the second time, they had a separate check in counter just for us and got all 50+ of us checked in, in 15 minutes and internet in the room worked immediately.

"The Oberoi, New Dehli is a clean and quiet hotel with lots of service.  I don't know how many times I was offered coffee at each breakfast and I don't even drink coffee. The Oberoi is a business hotel, so you will be greeted with guards at the gate and then airport style security when entering the building.  That was the only hotel that did that on our 4 week tour of India and we felt perfectly safe at the other places as well.  If you are someone who also enjoys walking out of a front door and being in the heart of city with markets nearby and such, this is not the hotel to stay at.

You can't move for 'Namaste' from the staff.

"This place has a great location, not far from one of the main stations and a couple of good markets. The golf course is right next door if thats your thing. Many other sites not too far away either.  Friendly, attentive and helpful staff.  Excellent breakfast, good selection from the buffet and hot options made fresh too.  Good selection on the dinner a la carte menu and we enjoyed our selections from there.  The pool looked good but we didn't get a chance to try it out.  The rooms are very well equipped and the shower was excellent.  The bar prices are quite high and it feels more setup for business travelers that holiday makers but those are the only negatives I can think of.",Date of stay: November 2013,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  Thank you so much for your very kind feedback.

"As we were only 10 days in India and we prepared ourselves for full and exhaustive days we booked good hotels. The Oberoi was no doubt the best! We could benefit from a corporate rate, so cannot comment on regular price, but I can definitely recommend this hotel: -	Service is second to none, already at the arrival you hand over the passports and while you relax in with a drink at bar formalities are taking care of. It continues without being intrusive They ask not to give tips to individual staff, which is also nice.  -	Breakfast is outstanding, buffet and complimentary a la carte options, including a good cappuccino. -	We didn’t try out the restaurant for lunch or dinner, but the restaurant was recommended as a good place to go to. -	Warmed outside and inside pool and steambad…",Date of stay: November 2013,bubble_50,"Dear Guest  It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi on your recent visit.

In particular, Mona in Guest Relations was fantastic. The bedroom, overlooking the golf course was comfortable, clean and have everything that we needed. The large, stand alone bath was a real treat.  We dined at 2 of the three restaurants. The international restaurant, 360, was staffed by the most attentive and friendly people. We stayed at two further Oberois where this attention was just a little bit too much but at this restaurant they have got it just right. The food was of a good, although not exceptional quality.

I moved for the next two nights (simply as a friend joined me and we moved to a twin) and we had a view of the golf course. This was definitely the better view and a quieter room. Attentive staff had given me a room near the lift as asked at booking and the service (including floor butler) throughout was excellent. The room was always super clean and had a great bathroom.

"I was very disappointed with this Oberoi hotel in many aspects.  When I first booked, 4 months in advance, they asked for my check-in time, and when I said 7.30 AM, they responded that they would gladly have the room ready so that we could check-in immediately, in order to rest from our long plane trip. One week before our arrival, as soon as  our cancellation date had expired, they wrote us saying that they had just noticed that we were arriving early so we  would have to pay for an extra day, giving us no choice to book elsewhere. Another thing that was upsetting was that they couldn’t give us 2 hours for a late check-out as they were allegedly fully book, although the place seemed quite empty.

The Oberoi is the perfect amalgamation of old and new, and as such, you can successfully retire from a long day of whatever Delhi has in store for you, and still remember that you are in one of the most magnificent cities on earth.

"Today i had a reunion with my old friends. i came all the way from Mumbai. I had heard a lot about Delhi's one of the oldest and finest Chinese restaurant. so we all decided to have a meal at Taipan. Reservation was done well in advance by a friend of mine. we had an amazing time. The restaurant was completely packed. initially we thought that its a wrong choice because the food will take time. BUT we were WRONG. Everything was on time. Above all the food was simply Superb. we had assortment of Dim Sums, stir fries from the wok and desserts.

The food was delivered in a container so that hot food was kept warm, and a staff efficiently and beautifully prepared a table brought for dinner.

The Travertino  is very popular  catering to the elite.  It is part of the Oberoil hotel in the capital. The decor is very elegant and the ambience is superb. I went to have dinner here this week which was very enjoyable . It started with organic mesclun fresh plum and toasted  hazelnut and raspberry dressing . which was followed by asparagus soup. The penne pasta with vegetables was just right while my friends praised the Asparagus and leek lasagna. We finished the dinner with smooth Tiramisu while my friends had chocolate mouse which was mouthwatering.

"Last week, I travelled to Delhi for a 2 day meeting which was fortunately held at the Oberoi Hotel. Our room rate included airport transfers and after a 15 hour trip, I was wondering what to expect. Yet no information could have prepared me with what happened. As I came out of immigration, I was immediately greeted by a driver in a white uniform and a hotel assistant in a black suit. Both welcomed me and led me to a lift. From there, I was alone with my driver who took me to a different level and walked with me to the car park. As I'm used to independent travel, I held on to my hand luggage, but god knows how many times he offered to take it from me.

"Good hotel / very business convention oriented / very average food.   Not my best experience. Nothing wrong per se. Good rooms, though not a patch on The Oberoi Bangalore. Food was the one thing I could not get over. Was just so average. I can't accept a Delhi based hotel to get Paneer Palak and Lacchha Parathas wrong! But they did - inspite of instructions. The cake shop is supposed to be awesome but I never got to try it. Breakfast was again average. A little of everything, nothing exceptional. Their coffee shop has an amazing ceiling.

"For the price, for the hype, you want your room to be better than adequate, and that's what keeps me from giving it that last star. In South Asia at nice hotels, the bathrooms are usually really something with glass walls and walk in tiled shower stalls with tubs separate in a large bathroom. This has a plane old tub, cloth curtain, shower set up with a toilet barely fitting between it and the sink unit. Not large, not especially well designed, not a luxury experience.  The room was fine. Just fine. Bed was comfortable, sheets nice, view of the golf course was green and nice, desk was good, but the Internet was outrageously slow.

A full glass wall on both rooms with view to the beautiful green park. The attention to detail from the daily refill of free array of chocolates and fruit, to the linens and pillows, so my wife says, is second to none in India.

Stayed at the New Delhi Oberoi for 3 nights in July. Rooms are comfortable and well furnished. They only provide 30 min of free wifi everyday though. Mentioned that to them in their feedback request and was told that the infrastructure costs are high. Found that hard to believe. Butler service was definitely very helpful. We visited the restaurant 360 for the included buffet breakfast which was extensive.  The best part of the stay was the service. Staff are extremely helpful and the travel concierge Mona was very resourceful.

"I stayed on 2 seperate occasions when I recently visited Delhi and have to say how helpful and courteous all the staff were. The hotel itself is in a very good central location just a stones throw from Kahn Market and a short drive from most of the main attractions like the Red Fort, India Gate and Connaught Place. I would advise using one of the hotels yellow and black taxis and get them to wait as is cheaper and safer than trying to get other taxis. The hotel rooms were fine with all the usual add-ons you would expect. The hotel pools were lovely and hardly used.

"I stayed in the Oberoi for two separate stays over a week. Five days in total.  The staff was the most helpful and nice staff I've ever encountered at a hotel. From the minute I arrived (at 2:00 am) they very quickly showed me my room and made sure I had everything I needed. This extended to the staff in the restaurants, spa and business center as well. I've never been treated so well.  The restaurants are good, though after 5 days I did get a little bored. That's not their fault though. Threesixty had a good brunch buffet included in the room price. I had a prawn coconut chilli entree there one night that was spectacular.

"Service excellent, facilities excellent, room excellent. The only disappointment for me was the food: breakfasts were excellent, but the main restaurant I found to have a limited choice of Indian food, was too formulaic and didn't compare favourably with other hotels and restaurants we visited.

"Given its brand, I had very high expectations of this hotel.  Alas, they were not fully met.  While first impressions were excellent – upon reaching the reception desk and passing over my passport, I was asked whether I’d like a drink while the paper work is completed, and this alcoholic drink was inclusive – I increasingly found flaws and areas for improvement.  These particularly concern the check-in procedure; the relatively colonial-like and old-fashioned rooms with features that need modernising; the need for greater attention to detail; and WiFi.

"Just back from a week long business trip to the oberoi.  Great restaurant, huge menu of western, European, Indian and Thai cuisine, also great room service menu. Brilliant as this can be repetitive when travelling frequently for business.  Staff perhaps too eager to help.. Not always with the productivity needed.   Whilst the restaurant is beautifully modern, it felt that the rooms were quite tired and in need of some updating.   The bedding did not feel as clean and fresh as I would have liked. The biggest problem was the strong smell of damp on the 6th floor corridor and bedrooms, I assume from the air conditioning? This was quite over powering and un pleasant.

Spent nearly 3 hours enjoying the ambiance and the world class cuisine.  A sincere request to the managment, not to have an attendant inside the mens room handing out napkins.

"One thing I dont like about hotels in General is when the bell captain or concierge insist on taking your hand luggage. My hand luggage is personal so please do not touch and insist on taking it.  Although the name Oberoi is great in the Indian market, the hotel was way below my expectations. The rooms need major refurbishment. Once you enter the hotel room, you will understand what old mean.   The Lobby is nice and has some great shops. In General I will categorize the hotel as a four star, rather then a five star hotel.

The staff are so so helpful - in suggesting places to visit or shopping tailored to your interests (ask for Mona) in organising hotel cars or taxis which wait for you so you can go on a real explore (the concierge team could not have been more helpful). We went for a day trip to Agra and the hotel organised a wonderful guide (Rachna) to meet us and the had a late lunch at the Oberoi in Agra. Wish we'd stayed to see the Taj Mahal at night.

The Oberoi New Delhi is absolutely charming. The room was good - however the bathroom - esp the shower was by far the best that I have seen world over. The staff and the service levels were fantastic.  Since I had an early morning flight I barely had time to have breakfast and I went to the coffee shop for a coffeee. There the staff saw me leave without eating and asked me whether I would like to pack a croissant - which I happily agreed and then they also offered me coffee on the go.. Simple things - but a great thought.. Have'nt seen any other hotel do this.. Also I enjoyed the lunch buffet the previous afternoon..

"My wife and I stayed at the Oberoi in April for one week. We had a lovely stay in as much as the staff are very helpful, the restaurants and bars are excellent and the atmosphere is relaxing (although the decor is quite jaded and out of date in the accomodation areas) the rooms are comfortable.   However, our stay was spoilt by a couple of things. We had arrived, from the airport in one of the hotel's own cars. On arrival we were ushered into the reception whilst the staff unloaded the car and put our things through the security screening.  Between unloading our baggage and delivering it to our room, they managed to lose both of my suits. As we were there for a wedding the following day, (not to mention that the suits were brand new and just made) this caused me quite a problem…",Date of stay: April 2013,bubble_30,"Dear Guest,  It was a pleasure having you stay with us at The Oberoi, New Delhi.

"Superb and fantastic! Loved the 5 nights I spent there. The room was rather standard in size. The bed.. superbly comfortable as were the pillows. Luxury at it's finest, even down to the toiletries. The buffet breakfast selection may not be as wide as I'm quite used to but I was only interested in the delicious Indian breakfast. The fact that you could also order from the menu and i loved the juice bar. Service was excellent overall. Loved the personal touch by housekeeping when arriving back from a day trip to Agra we find some flowers and a little gift on our bed with a personal handwritten note.

"I'm a regular to The Oberoi in New Delhi over many years - and it has always been a haven in the city. However, wanted to record an exceptionally positive experience from my recent stay. Used the gym, which is first class - good machines, light, bright and airy etc - and on departure from the hotel left my Polar heart rate monitor in my room.

We were invited to sit and have a cold drink in the lounge while the arrival formalities were completed. A lovely woman then showed us to our room (we opted for a suite). While the suite was a bit smaller than we expected, it turned out to be really comfortable and quiet.

This place has all the trappings of a 5 star hotel.  Staff were omnipresent though never over-bearing.  The Concierge desk was particularly helpful in arranging trips.  We had a standard room but it was a good size, easily able to accommodate an extra bed for our 8 year old whilst the 6 year old slept happily on the couch (the hotel are fine with younger kids, we think under 10, doing this at no extra cost but it would be worth checking if you are in the same position).

There's no doubt about it that, on the whole, the Oberoi is a luxury hotel with service and facilities to match.  But I expected more - that x-factor - which I found lacking.

"Realy faultless at the very top end of the scale. The room was fabulous - enormous, well-appointed, butler service, beautiful furnishings - with an excellent (if small) bathroom and water pressure that would remove the barnacles from the hull of your boat. The wood panelling might get a bit tedious after a while but for short stays, the ""clubby"" atmosphere works well. Location is excellent for the Lodhi Road area although a bit of a ride (40 mins +) from the airport. Public areas are glamorous rather than welcoming and the opulence also gets in your face after a while. The bar is comfortable but not exciting. It's all genteel wealth and large-scale bling.

That would've been a mistake, as The Oberoi proved to be a wonderful base for exploring Delhi. It's well located, boasts a terrific, well-equipped fitness center, lovely indoor and outdoor swimming pools, and a nice business center. The room was unremarkable, but nice enough, and the service was excellent.

"This is a wonderful hotel with wonderful staff. Efficient pickup from the train station.We really enjoyed our stay. Don't miss exploring Nizzamudin West which is just across the road and provides a fascinating insight into the everyday lives of the predominantly Muslim population that lives there. Good food, wonderful swimming pools (indoor and outdoor), fabulous (small) sauna. The only real negative is the Internet charges. 300 rupees for 30 mins (£3.64, US$5.53) or 990 rupees for 24 hours (£12). I see on the web that I can get a single en suite room at the Smyle Inn Hostel (overall Tripadvisor rating 3.5) in Delhi for £8.78/night including free breakfast and free wifi.

"Great service and clean property, beautiful gardens. My room was huge with two beds put together to make one king bed. There was only one frosted window leading out into the hall; no outside windows. The bathroom was gorgeous with a huge step-up tub. Excellent water pressure means a misty and slippery bathroom but it was nice! Breakfast was good. Servers extremely attentive and asked repeatedly if they could bring me pancakes or french toast. One asked me if I liked the Indian food. Of course! So he brought me a special parantha without cilantro.

Pros: good central location, nice large restaurant with good breakfast and dinner options, pleasant room service with welcome bottle of wine and (excellent) macaroons upon arrival.

"We splurged for my husband's 50th birthday and stayed at five different Oberoi Hotels throughout India. To say that it wasn't the most superb experience ever would be an understatement. Beginning with the girls at the booking office, who handled all of my inquiries (and one hundred and one changes to our itinerary!!), down to the new pool boy who was just perfect and so keen to impress in his new job and the valet that escorted us through the train station with our packed bag of goodies from the hotel!

But by God you pay for it, a decent meal and bottle of wine leaves no change out of Rs10,000 and the hotel is too far from any alternative without calling up a  driver etc If you require absolute comfort at a price this a hotel for you",Date of stay: February 2013,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  I sincerely thank you for your encouraging and kind words of praise for our sister hotel, The Oberoi Gurgaon.

"I stayed at the Oberoi during a trip with Boston University. The rooms were very well constructed with very nice materials. I stayed in a double twin bed room and the twin beds were right up against one another which was uncomfortable for me given I was staying with someone I didn't know well. The breakfast in the hotel was just gorgeous. Lots of selection and extremely great service. We realized how great the service was when we left the Oberoi and went to the Trident in Mumbai. It made a big difference. The concierge Mark was very friendly, he helped me plan out a day in Delhi before the program started. The pool facilities were great - it was chilly during our stay, but the heated outdoor pool that you access through the spa was gorgeous. I loved the landscaping. The indoor…",Date of stay: January 2013,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for your kind words of appreciation and encouragement.

"This is a great hotel, the rooms, the facilities, the service and the location is great for the central part of Delhi. I especially liked the gym, and the comprehensive range of equipment there. However many of the restaurants and services such as laundry are very overpriced, and you have no easy alternative, as the location is not close to any shops or restaurants.

"Since India can be overwhelming for a Western tourist, we figured we'd indulge ourselves with a little luxury and stay at the Oberoi at the beginning and end of our week-long tour of Rajasthan.  The delightful surprise was that, on balance, the Oberoi experience felt like the very best value of the trip.  Not only were airport transfers included, but so were (excellent) breakfasts, a dinner for two . . . and (ta-da!) an upgrade to a suite.  And the intelligent, responsive service!   We've been spoiled by an industry (luxury hospitality) that has raised customer service to a fine art.  But, even in an Indian culture still struggling with the important distinction between obsequiousness and service, the Oberoi stands out as best in class.

"Stayed for 3 nights over valentines period Feb 2013, this hotel, as do all Oberois I've stayed in, excels in its individuality, quality and service.

"The hotel is really old school in terms of its rooms. One can tell that the rooms haven't been upgraded in about twenty years.  They are clean, but definately NOT luxury!  The saving grace in the hotel is was the heated lap pool in a modern spa in the basement and the restaurant which was quite good. Oh yes, and I ordered breakfast to the room (breakfast is not included in the room rate) and got ice cold eggs and worse than that - I asked for a fresh fruit platter where it was obvious that the fruit was pre-cut and put in the fridge so I got ice crystals in my watermelon - not a fun experience early in the morning !",Date of stay: January 2013,bubble_30,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for your encouraging comments about the hotel's facilities especially the heated lap pool and spa.

This was a blast from the past in colonial terms. The public areas have been refurbished and offer both beatiful modern decor and a step back in time to the colonial yesteryaer of style and elegance. The staff as ever at an Oberoi are faultless and the food and service was just as good. If you are there on a Wednesday evening go to the wine tasting which is excellent value and very informative.

The Beatles also arrived here for a brief stay early during the morning on July 6, 1966, primarily for George Harrison to buy a sitar. We stayed on the 4th floor, a few doors down from Room 438, the suite where The Beatles stayed. I wonder if they also enjoyed their stay as much as we did.  The hotel is located centrally so that travel to and most places in Delhi is convenient. There's a well appointed gym which my wife and I used, and indoor and outdoor lap pools.

The weather in February was chilly and so I was not able to take advantage of some of the outdoor amenities the hotel has to offer, but inside was wonderful. Starting with tight security on arrival the staff was wonderful. The room was clean and comfortable and very well decorated.  Dining was in a first class, modern and lovely restaurant 360 in the hotel. There are others available but we loved 360. I can't tell you how impressed I was with the staff.

"I stayed at an Oberoi property after more than a decade!! The last I stayed at an Oberoi was in Mumbai and I still have pleasant memories of it. It is only because they have limited properties or at some property they do not allow kids below 10 years, else Oberoi would be my first choice.   The difference between other 5 star hotels and Oberoi is the extra effort their staff puts to make you feel special. Be it the check-in, the breakfast, the facilities, the restaurant - you can see that the staff makes an effort to understand your requirements and fulfill to the maximum possible extent.

It is without doubt the best service I have ever received at any hotel.  The best example of how great the Oberoi service is is that we arrived at the hotel at the same time as the President of Nepal and not for a second were we made to feel any less important by the staff.  Check-in was done in the comfort of our room. While I unfortunately do not recall the names of the staff members, the staff members I interacted with remembered mines and throughout my stay I was always greeted by name.

However after staying at this location for 8 days we found bugs in the breakfast buffet. We got sick a couple of times from the eggs. And finally something that agitated us very very much was how small the bathrooms were.   It was ridiculous, my wife slipped and hit her head on the toilet seat. There was no understanding from management. We ate food with bugs in it by accident, they said they would have a doctor organized for us just in case, but it was never done.

However, the baby highchairs in the exquisite dining areas were inadequate.  The highchairs were more suitable for older children and not safe enough for babies.  This made the dining experience at the Oberoi very challenging as our baby always had to sit on our laps and anyone with children will know how tiring it is to feed a baby like this.

"I was in India for a week with five days at the Oberoi.  The staff is absolutely incredible.  From greeting you by name at the restaurant to greeting you at the front door with a smile, I felt very comfortable and appreciated. Mona was especially helpful recommending places to visit in my free time and Anshul at 360 was wonderfully considerate.  Prices are as you would expect for a 5 star hotel and staff friendliness would be 6 star if I could rate it as such.  Don't forget to bring a swimsuit as I did - the outdoor pool is set to 85 degrees and in December looked amazing.  I didn't try the spa, but the facilities (gym, showers) are nice and very modern.

"I had to stay here for an extended period of time on business last month. The staff was nothing but outstanding. The concierges desk helped me plan and book two weekend trips outside of delhi with no issues and then even had the charges put on my room instead of me having to pay the vendor. I ate at all the restaurants on the property and would recommend them all. The gym facilities were great and there was always someone there with a bottle of water for you. One of the parts I liked was the pillow menu. They had 5 or so pillows to choose from for your comfort and it made dealing with the jet lag pretty nice. The down side is the rooms seem a tad outdated for the price being paid, but the service of the staff well makes up for that.",Date of stay: November 2012,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  Thank you for your words of appreciation and encouragement for our team.

"It's not a beauty on the outside, but this is a truly world class hotel in terms of service.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Our suite was excellent, although I've seen larger bathrooms.    The team on reception and concierge were outstanding.  We missed breakfast twice (included in our deal) due to early mornings, but they did a very good packed breakfast for us.

"I visited on a business trip, the hotel was nice, the service wasn't as nice as the previous hotel.  My room was luxurious, breakfast was sensational.  The main detractions for me were the noise from the roads on both sides of the hotel (my colleague told me it was as bad on his side), internet was absolutely extortionate and I've no idea why it's not included in the cost of the room.

"This was an excellent hotel with five star service.  The staff was amazing and really followed up on our requests and needs.  They even contacted us prior to our departure from home to confirm time of arrival for our booked airport pick up.  The 360 restaurant breakfasts were also extremely good and the modern decor was pleasing.  While I rate this a five star hotel for service, I have given in four stars because the rooms, while clean and excellent in every way, did show a bit of wear, particularly in the bathrooms.

It did not disappoint.  Check-in was quick and efficient and were told that we had received a nice upgrade to a suite.  I am sometimes dubious about upgrades (don't get me wrong, I love them) but this time it did not disappoint.  We were escorted to room 650 which was right at the end of the corridor.  Proudly in brass at the door were the words ""The Kipling Suite"" and sweet it was!  This is a very large room and from what I understand, one of their largest.

The food in the 360 Restaurant is very good, with the best breakfast buffet choices we saw in any of the five hotels we stayed in.  Mona was extremely helpful and friendly and gave us a very useful information sheet on things to see in her home town of Udaipur which we were to visit in a few days’ time.  It was a pleasure to see her again on the morning of our departure two weeks later.

The butler service is incredible - fresh icetea when you just come in is a treat. Highly efficient and good quality laundry.   The reason for my very good rating is the looks of the building and the somewhat outdated room. However, staff is extremely helpful and attentive. The club room bar is nothing special, but has a good selection of drinks and comfortable seating.   All in all a good place to stay for a couple of days when in Delhi - provided you are willing to spend the money on the rooms that is.   Relatively close to city center and India gate.

The staff are excellent, and very friendly. If staying in a high end room or suite, a butler is included and in my experience they are very knowledgeable and kindness itself. Delhi now has much newer, more glamorous hotels and these may well have poached a lot of the top staff, but the name Oberoi in India is synonymous with luxury and superb service.

My stay was after the stay at Oberoi Gurgaon and the two are not comparable.

Its at a good central location so most Delhi locations would be easily accessible.  The service is super, I liked the way restaurants are placed, the food available, morning breakfast spead and variety...all of that.

"On Oct 19, I checked in at The Oberoi, New Delhi around 10:30am. I was warmly received at the main door, whisked away to Room 542, where the check in formalities were completed. No hassles about waiting in the lobby with the excuse, "" your room is not ready....check in from 2pm etc,etc "" ! The room was spacious, immaculately clean and facing the golf course. Bathroom was very clean and of good size. A continental breakfast was served immediately ( on the house ) with a smile. What touched me most was the prayer rug & Islamic compass (Qibla indicator) on the table. I have stayed in many hotels in my four+ decades business trips all over the world, but have never experienced this kind of thoughtful & warm gesture !  Buffet breakfast was lavish.

"I recently stayed here for one night on business and had a fantastic experience. I arrived into DEL very early in the morning and there was the hotel driver waiting to greet me, right on time out front. There was also an Oberoi staff member there at the Airport to check that all was okay before sending me on my way with the driver. The car was very clean and the driver was appropriately talkative as needed. What first surprised me was the fact that at six in the morning they had a room cleaned and ready for me. The front desk staff escorting me to my room and handling the entire check-in process there at the time.

"We chose this hotel because it was a special birthday treat, a country we've always wanted to visit and a love of Indian food. We were in touch with the hotel before we arrived as I wanted to book a cooking experience and spice tour. They promised me that they would make this a birthday to remember and they did. It was amazing from start to finish in every way.  For starters - we were so lucky to have been upgraded to a suite which was he size of an apartment! It was such a treat.  A cake and a bottle of wine was waiting in our dining area when we arrived. Check in was easy and carried out in our room.  The bed was so comfortable and the shower was in a room in its own right!

"Stayed here twice over the summer with Mom and both of us were taken aback by the sheer excellence in service that comes with ease to the Oberoi Team. After having dined in the hotel on several occasions for over a decade, got to try the suites this summer. The suites have lush green gold course views, warm interiors which are impeccably maintained and service that is second to none!   The Oberoi Delhi is by far India's finest business hotel and the finest in Delhi for sure.   We used to stay at the competition across but due to the arrogant staff there and rude managers- decided to move to the Oberoi.

They are naturally superb just as in any Oberoi property -  with a lovely imperial-India ambiance.   Just will mention couple of things on that matter: the location is perfect for any Delhi trip – right in the middle of the city yet with an amazing lush green park surrounding the hotel so you don’t really feel the hectic beat of Delhi.  The view from my room was incredible-  especially enjoyed the sunset! The pool area and the gym are very clean and very comfy. The Spa is terrific!

It is a lovely property, and my room was just right--size, amenities, comfortable bed, temperature controls, clean with good work lighting at night, and a lot of natural light during the day.   Excellent breakfast buffet.  But most of all, the staff were excellent from the greeters and drivers at the airport to the friendly desk and knowledgeable concierge to the efficient but unobstrusive cleaning staff.  The warmth and friendliness felt natural and honest.

This was our first trip to India and we stayed for two nights in Dehli.   From the moment of arrival every encounter with an employee was met with ""it's our pleasure"".   One of the chefs at breakfast went out of his way to create a culinary delight of ethnic India food, both North and South food for my husband to enjoy.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.

"Although the hotel is not exactly an architectural classic from the outside, on the inside it is brilliant.  The rooms are comfortable with wood panelled bathrooms (which are sort of getting a bit old now and could do with a bit of an upgrade) and the external areas are all in very good condition.  The bar is a bit chintzy but quite pleasant and the breakfast buffet is absolutely excellent.  The pool / spa area is probably the best bit of the hotel, really nicely landscaped and well-staffed.  The service at the hotel is really good, perhaps too attentive at times - there is only so many times I want to be asked if I need assistance in a day....

"The Oberoi is a lovely hotel. They place a premium on service, at times to the point of being a bit overwhelming. A nice feature is that you give your tip at the end, and it is distributed among all staff, although you can recognize someone who has been especially helpful.  Make sure to check out the view from the deck on the top floor.  The food is reasonably good although I was a bit disappointed with the breads and fruit at breakfast. Our dinner at the main restaurant was lovely. The pool is wonderful, but the gym is only so-so. It is a narrow set of two rooms that affords little privacy.

The staff are excellent and the lobby and restaurants are very good. The rooms are good, but I could not give them 5 stars. The bathroom in my room was quite small, fine for one person, but I'd hate to be in a rush when accompanied. I also found the restaurant to be too expensive. I paid 3500 for the Sunday buffet (without champagne), which seems steep. The restaurant service is very attentive but a little slow. The lack of advertised prices for the buffet was also a little anoying.

Room service is also excellent. Even if you just order a sandwich, the way it is served makes you feel pampered. The bed is wonderful and you get a menu of pillows.

"I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights on business. Having arrived at New Delhi International airport just after 2300, I was very quickly through Immigration (puts Heathrow to shame!) and baggage to be greeted in the Arrivals Hall by a driver bearing my name and that of the Oberoi Hotel. My room package included breakfast and an airport pick-up. I was swiftly taken to the hotel in an air-conditioned limousine, having been treated en route with a cold flannel and bottle of ice cold water. The journey took about 30 minutes (but allow 45-60 minutes during the day)  Upon arrival at the hotel, I was surprised at the high level of security.

The lobby is just a wonderful place to be in this hotel and when you explore the lobby a little bit you will notice a great piece of art at the end of the lobby that amplifies the overall charm a lot.

"I haven't stay at this hotel, but I am frecuent costumer of their restaurant: the 360. So I will tell you my overall opinion of the Oberoi New Delhi.  The location is excellent, 10 min from Humayuns Tomb, 15 min from Lotus temple, 25-30 min from India Gate, Cannought Place, 35-40 min from Old Delhi and just next to Delhi Golf course.  The service in the Oberoi is outstanding, always very helpful, they always recognize, giving me a warm welcome, sometimes a drink of courtesy and asking me why I took me so long to come back (I go there at least one every 3 weeks for dinner).   The 360 is a very good restaurant, it serves indian, continenal and it has a sushi bar.

"The word on the street is that the Oberoi New Delhi is due for an upgrade...I have to say I am not quite sure why. The rooms are not cutting edge modern but the place has a style of its own. The thing that makes it a great place to stay are the staff who really are excellent. This is not to say it all goes 100% right first time but they go out of their way to correct even the smallest thing that's gone wrong. The beer's not cold enough (and it wasn't) then apologies, a colder one and no charge plus please taste some of the owners daughters wine from Australia.

The pool area was a bit odd; one pool was apparantly not  actually for swimming in (which confused our kids) but when we found the right one it was good and clean.

"There cannot be many 5 star hotels that are in a forest overlooking a golf course but also in the centre of a major capital.  The Oberoi is close to India Gate, 30-60 minutes from the airport.  Service is immaculate, and, unlike other hotels, there are clear notices in the rooms saying that individual tipping is not encouraged.  The hotel has a boutiquey feel to it but rooms are large.  Internet is not cheap and, being old, some of the plugs did not work.  Nice lounge and breakast areas.

"I stayed here for a long weekend with 7 friends in October of last year (sorry for the late review). I will start with the negatives (there aren't many). When we arrived, they had not yet arranged which rooms we would be staying in. After a long flight from the UK, it seemed like an extremely long 15 minute wait before we got our room keys, but in retrospect, had I not been so tired and felt so groggy I would not have minded the wait since the views across India were fantastic from reception with the vast woodland. Now, onto the positives.. the welcome was fantastic since we received leis and bindis from the staff in traditional dress as we stepped out of the car.

It was great to have the pool to relax by at the end of the trip-India can be quite taxing so this was well needed.  Our last night we decided to request a movie, so we ""rang for the butler"".

This is a beautifully appointed hotel comfortably at the top of its game.  The rooms here are well appointed but a little small and arguably dated. The public rooms are modern and funky with liberal scatterings of tasteful art. The staff and service are outstanding. Dining is as good as it gets in my opinion. Drinks are a little pricy but then you are paying for much more than just the drink! I can't really offer tips here as you won't be disappointed.

"Right from the word go it was absolutely delightful. Landed at New Delhi airport terminal early hours of the morning, a luxurious S class Merc driven by a very well behaved chauffeur took me to the hotel in no time where Sameer kaul the Duty Manager took me upstairs to my room to do in-room check-in which got over in no time so that I could catch up some sleep before embarking upon my meetings during the day. My stay was short. Just barely 24 hours. But it was unforgettable, the way highly energetic people like Ranjit Nalwa, Parikshit Bajaj, Ramandeep Kukreja, Sheena Tandon and the other team members took special care of me.

"First off we have stayed at the Oberoi on two different occasions while in Delhi and it truly is a beautiful hotel and lovely place to stay.  HOWEVER, I'm writing to chat about the horrific reservation process I had recently.  I called to ask if I could book a room in November.  I was told November was too far away on the calendar and I would need to send an email.. Fair enough.  My email was promptly answered with details of rooms and rates.  I followed up straight away with a phone call to ask some more questions regarding the email and this is where is all went pear shaped.

"Delhi, India and a number of places we love to visit have one look out. Do not drink the tap water, whether that be through taps, showers, salads, ice cubes or otherwise. The risk is you will fall ill.   Oberoi however is the only hotel I have found which is certainly clean water. Even the Sheraton does not have completely clean water filtrage for showers.  This means you can accidentally drink the water in the shower and you will not fall ill. Also, your skin will not feel pasty after a week or two of showering with unclean water.  Sound over-fussy? Well, besides the beautiful hotel in all other respects, individual focussed food catering, elegant but not over the top surroundings, the water just wins it for me!",Date of stay: November 2011,bubble_50,Dear Guest  We sincerely thank you for your encouraging and kind words of praise for our hotel and services.

"I recently went to India on holiday and stayed at the Oberoi. This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The surroundings and hotel itself were beautiful, but what made my stay memorable was the level of service I received at every level. The staff could not do enough to make my stay more comfortable or special. Their english was impeccable and staff took time to converse.

In fact, I registered with this site for the explicit purpose of reviewing the Oberoi...it's that good.  I stayed here for week this March for work.  Getting to India was an absolute nightmare.  My flights were delayed, the airline lost my luggage, and I didn't arrive in New Delhi until 3:30 in the morning, by which point I had been travelling for 26 hours and was deliriously tired.  The only thing that went right was the service provided by the Oberoi.  They provided transport from the airport, which was reassuring given all my troubles in arriving.

I told the reception the next morning and ask them to investigate. No news from them the evening. I reask the following morning and someone informs me that is was the maid service that had gone to the wrong room and they were sorry.

Beginning with the pick up with a limousine from the airport, to the reception at the hotel, to the breakfast (ordering from the menu was included in the room price), to the pool and gym and the different restaurants with international cuisine: the Oberoi is definitely one of the best hotels in New Delhi and has a really excellent first class service (this all in my opinion is worth the higher price). Only the rooms are average for this class of hotels and compared to international standards: if your room doesn't face the golf course/pool it's really noisy as you are facing a main road to the center of Delhi with traffic starting early in the morning (6 a.m.) and you can hear the doorman calling for taxis from the car park…",Date of stay: January 2012,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  We sincerely thank you for your encouraging and kind words of praise for our hotel and services.

Flawless smiles, friendly conversation without you feeling encroached upon.   The room was super clean and comfortable. Ample storage to unpack and set yourself up. Nice TV and great pressure in the shower head!   But the breakfast was the icing on the cake. Delicious made to order omelets and a buffet to die for.

"My in-laws, husband, and I had a lovely 3 night stay at the Oberoi. The rooms were clean and nicely appointed. The business center was calm, quiet and truly a place where you could conduct business or work if necessary. In typical Indian tourist fashion, I was feeling quite ill by the time we reached New Delhi. I ordered room service and while the waiter was setting up the table and our meal, he overheard me telling my husband I felt feverish again. He informed us the hotel had an on call doctor and volunteered to call him for us (this was about 11pm and the doctor arrived relatively quickly thereafter). We agreed and thank god we did because after 1 day of antibiotics, I was feeling like myself again.   Since I was a bit ill, we only ate at 360 but all of the food was lovely.…",Date of stay: December 2011,bubble_50,"Dear Guest,  I sincerely thank you for your encouraging and kind words of praise for our hotel and services.

"Qualifier: this is the only hotel I've stayed at in Delhi, so I have no basis of comparison.   This was a business trip. Long work days requiring proximity to the diplomatic area of Delhi, room service and the absolute necessity of a fitness centre. The Oberoi absolutely satisfied these requirements with comfort, service and good facilities.   That said, when you are a 5 star hotel, customers quibble about details and value, which I will.  First, the Oberoi is pricey, especially when you factor in the restaurant food, which ranges from good to very good but never great. The restaurants have received a clean-lined modern overhaul that does not fit with the lobby or the rooms. The new, modern fitness centre and new heated outdoor pool did make me very happy and feel better about…",Date of stay: December 2011,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  I sincerely thank you for your encouraging and kind words of praise for our hotel and services.

"Stayed at The Oberoi New Delhi for four nights and days which felt like one too long a day in New Delhi, but the hotel made it much more comfortable. The service at any Oberoi is deservedly famous and the concierges like Mona are incredibly helpful and personable and help you carve a good visit of sites. The Oberoi also set us up with a good guide, which we did for one day, helpful in Old Delhi and through the markets. Rooms are very nice and well appointed (I always appreciated when there's an international charger provided) and the location is central. Taxis are inexpensive so you are encouraged to simply have taxis wait for you wherever you go which worked out very very well.

"This is a good business hotel with all the functionality and luxury one would expect in a hotel of its class. What sets it apart is the excellent service offered by the staff. Despite it being very busy and chaotic at times, the staff are always attentive, efficient and pleasant. The housekeeping department is absolutely exemplary - their little gestures here and there provided evidence that a lot of thought went into making the room up exactly as I would want it based on what I had strewn about. When I finally left an item behind on checkout, they found it and couriered it to Australia.

I wonder how that immaculate condition of the car is maintained on Indian road.  On arrival at 10 past mid night, our check-in ladies awaited us on the drive way.  They each escorted into our room immediately.   The in-room check in was little odd at such odd hours of the night.  Luggage quickly followed.  The butler of the floor came in 5 mins later with a cordial as welcome drink.  Sorry the champagne flute does not make it classy.    The room is nice and big and very comfortable.

What a disappointment to experience this immediately on arrival.

It insulates you from India (good thing) and you are cocooned in an air-conditioned space.  The food is outstanding, best Indian food we had - the opposite experience was provided by the Westin Hyderabad which should be avoided at all cost.  In fact that goes for Hyderabad as a whole.  The hotel provided a guide to take us to the train station.  This proved to be invaluable.

A good business hotel with really mordern public spaces and restaurant .The rooms seem dated and I felt cramped. Carpets and furniture is too loud and the view of the road accross was uninteresting. This was my business trip before I left on a tour of Rajasthan and I felt that I could have chosen the newer Oberoi. The bathrooms here felt small ; though the amenities were very good.  I loved the breakfast at 360 . The service was great too.  The only irritation was the price of the wifi-charged in a business hotel ??,Date of stay: September 2011,bubble_40,"Dear Guest,  I sincerely thank you for your kind words of praise for the quality of food and services  I have taken careful note of your comment on the rooms and the internet pricing.

"We stayed here for one night after a long flight from London. The outside is a bit dated but inside it is beautiful.   The staff were great, we ate in 360 restaurant and it was good. The Indian wine was suprisingly drinkable at 550 rps a glass.  The pool area is really lovely with nice gardens....we were the only people there. When you sit down they immediately bring you cold flannels, sun tan lotion, rosewater spray, bottled water and fruit juice....a really lovely touch.  There were some small errors on the bill when we left - easily sorted when we mentioned it. Our guide did say this is quite common at many hotels I.e.

"After being left at the airport for over an hour only to get lost for two hours in a local taxi, the oberoi started their resolution of this with a cake in our room. First the room was very outdated, second we found three spiders on the walls in the first five minutes and third cake does not resolve these matters, especially when you've come half way around the world to spend 11 days with this hotel group in India.. It was not until we had a very nice conversation with the manager that we were upgraded and given a complimentary meal. The room was outstanding, to say the least, and really quelled some of the disappointment with this and several other issues we had with oberoi over our 11 days.

"Spent three nights at the Oberoi in New Delhi.  For a 5 star hotel, the phyiscal infrastructure was only okay but the staff was outstanding.  From check in to check out they were helpful, attentive, and effective.  I particularly appreciated their help dealing with my food allergy.  I was at the hotel for a workshop and the staff not only dealt with my dietary restrictions but were very pre-emptive about it at group lunches and dinners in a way that was very minimizing on the effect to the event.  During private meals in the 360 restaurant, the staff were able to very effectively help me determine what to eat and how to best enjoy my meal.    Room was nice (shower in our hotel in Gurgaon was better).  TV had multiple US and British stations including a movie station.

"We stayed at the Oberoi for two nights while in India.  This hotel looks imposing and cold from the outside but is actually very warm and inviting once inside.  The lobby and public spaces are beautiful and staff efficient and kind.  Our room was what you'd expect from an Oberoi, extremely comfortable, clean and well-appointed.  Our breakfast buffet in the restaurant was incredible with a great selection.  The staff in the restaurant was wonderful and will bring you nearly anything you want.  For a hotel this size, the pool seating was rather small and service there was lacking.  We had many problems trying to get food and cocktails delivered to the pool but luckily, after speaking to the manager, we were not charged for our pool expenses.

The lobby is impressive as you enter, rooms are functional and comfortable, more on the traditional side than with the latest trends. I have to highlight two service that I have never seen anywhere else so far. Once your driver picks you up the airport you have a personal assistant walking you to the car briefly explaining the hotel facilities and giving you the option to order your dinner right from the hotel car on the way to the hotel, so you don;t need to wait for your food once you get there.

"Was here recently and must say that, aside from the coffee shop, 360, this hotel is long overdue for refurbishment. The rooms appear well-worn and small things were broken and remained broken even when the engineer was supposed to have fixed them. In a 5 star hotel!. Service continues to be slow. The best part of the hotel is the lush, green grounds surrounding the back of the hotel. The gym is quite good for an Indian hotel.  The most disturbing thing about this visit is that hotel staff must have been instructed to call you by your name everywhere. When housekeeping takes 20 minutes to show up at your room when you are rushing to breakfast in the morning, whether the waiter calls you by your name really doesn't matter.

I had breakfast and dinner in the restaurants which were spot on. In fact, the breakfast staff were not the same each day but somehow knew that I like a strong latte coffee ---  maybe they checked my previous day's order, I don't know but very impressed. I am not usually a big fan of room service, but I arrived in at 1am and ordered pizza and a glass of wine, the sommelier even came my room to describe the wine and allow me to try the wine   Concierge was great --- gave me his mobile number in case of problems getting about, which I did use.

"Although the hotel was generally ok, except for the room service, which was expensive and inferior to the food outside, when we came to pay our bill of more than 100,000 rupees they scammed me by distracting me by asking me to fill out a questionnaire about our stay while they converted the bill the pounds sterling at a very inferior rate.   I did not notice the switch and they did not inform me that they were changing the currency, we were out around $200 as a result. I noticed the scam in the car on the way to the airport when I checked the bill, I was fuming all the way to our next destination.   This scam is standard Oberoi practice as they repeated it on as at Jaipur and then tried to deny that they had done so.

What really sets it apart is it's staff- they could not have been friendlier and the level of service was extraordinary. They seem to anticipate your every need and the warmth and kindness of each staff member was incredible. I happened to be there on my birthday and they brought a surprise birthday cake to my room- several members of the staff came to my room and sang Happy Birthday to me. They said that they did not want me to spend my birthday alone and wanted to bring a bright spot to the day.

I am a frequent business traveler, and am fortunate that I generally stay in better hotels.  It is also my third trip to India in the last three years and have stayed at beautiful properties in Delhi- the Taj and the Imperial- both of which are very nice.  But my stay at the Oberoi was so remarkable- the hotel is lovely, but it is really the service and staff that make it one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at.

"Business trip to New Delhi, again at very short notice and for a night only. Stayed at the Oberoi, which is somewhere close to the center of the city. First things first: since I had to complete a presentation (it is well past mid-night when I checked in),  i was given free access to Belvedere, their exclusive private member club on the ground floor. Awesome place to find some peace and quiet in this happening hotel. The fashionistas of Delhi are flitting in and out of the hotel drinking hole--I think it is called 360. But I stay focussed on the presentation--on a very empty stomach. There is a small bar in the club, and despite the late hour, the hostess offers to get me some comfort food. Charming.

The room is fabulous, and so the amenities and everything else. Could no try the restaurant, but went down for a cigarette and noticed how nice it is.

"My wife and I spent the weekend, enjoying a suite with butler service. Lovely room, finished in ample teak wood, and very good service. Only criticism is something often found across India (but should NOT be the case in a hotel of this level) -- the bathroom sink faucet was installed in a slightly moronic fashion whereby the tap is a bit too far back from the sink so half the water ends up on the counter. This is an annoyance that I had not expected in a room at this -rather high- price. The '360' restaurant was excellent, as was the (pricey but excellent) spa.

The food is amazing. I thought it was a good sign when we went in and there were a lot of Buddhist monks eating there. My spring rolls were cooked in some magic oil which leaves no trace and my husbands greens with noodles was excellent. I ordered jasmine tea to follow. This came as a tight dried ball of tea which unfurled and flowered in the hot water, truly beautiful. I have never seen this before.  The outdoor pool and garden is very nice.

You get room on either side and all you see is green expanse for miles, that too in the heart of New Delhi.  I said fairly old because when you enter the room the decor tells you that it is 70's style. I trust this hotel was built in early 1970s. It is fairly well maintained but if you keenly observe you can see some signs of ageing. Still not as bad as some younger five star properties.

"I was lucky enough to stay here for a week in April and what an amazing experience it was. The staff are fantastic, nothing was too much trouble, i was treated like a princess.    The lobby, restaurant, pool and gym areas appear to have been recently refurbished and are very modern. The bedrooms are a little old fashioned (this was my first visit to india so i'm not sure how they compare to others) but the rooms were well equipped and had everything you could possibly need. They were immaculately clean and the maid came twice a day.   The 360 restaurant offered a huge array of food from just about every continent but the indian food was by far the best. i loved the indian breakfast food it was much better than the buffet.

We were told stories about people getting sick from the food they ate in their hotels.

"From the outside, the building looks like a concrete block from the seventies but the interior is Italian-chic. I often felt like I was in Milan with a few Indian touches, which is great for biz travellers who want peace and little distraction but a pity nevertheless. Besides the Italian restaurant (who goes to Delhi to eat Italian?), I loved the coffee at breakfast, asked if it was South Indian brew, only to be informed proudly that they were Lavazza beans. There is a bit of comedy in this. The jeunesse doree of Delhi with their Kelly bags (Hermes boutique down the hall), and gold lame salvaar kameez clearly bask in the European atmosphere.

"Due to previous experiences, we had specified Oberoi's only wherever possible in India.  Although the Delhi Oberoi is advertised as a business hotel rather than resort, it was quite beautiful and I agree with all of the previous positive comments.  Aside from the excellent service, food and atmosphere, the best part for me was getting in at 1 AM after flying from California and being offered a pillow menu.  I took my two down pillows and slept like a baby.  The bedding, bed and linens were sublime and that was most important to me in the middle of the night.  Since the hotel is a bit out of the chaos of the City, it's quite quiet.  We were able to sleep until noon and then enjoy a few hours of sight seeing.  As I noted, I saw less of Delhi than other areas due to jet lag.

"The Oberoi in Delhi is a fine hotel.  Very strong security on entry and high attention to customer service.  Based on previous reviewers I asked if I could change the original room they offered so that I could look out onto the golf course.  I am not a golfer, but the landscape is great from the enormous bedroom windows.  One of the comfiest beds I have slept on in a hotel. Great food - both in the restaurants (tried 360 and had some amazing Japanese food - very surprised and the Chinese restaurant was pretty good too) and also room service.  Good gym and two swimming pools (the older one is a now no longer used - too overlooked by the buildings).   Good buffet breakfast.

"This hotel has to be one of the finest hotels in the world, when it was built. Not any more. The hotel lacks committed staff to deliver the simplest of things to its clients . Mr Oberoi and his family always saw to these tiny details and had made this property the envy of Delhi. The staff need extensive training to match the mark of a hotel that receives some of the worlds finest clients. The hotel is drab and needs some renovations to brighten up.

"After my trip through India I decided to end my traveling with some Spa treatments on my last days in New Delhi and what I found did really exceed my expectations. After experiencing the amazing hospitality of India, I was did not expect to find a place which could top this but the Oberoi in New Delhi did! I was looking for some time for myself, a good spa and good food and I got this and more. It seemed like the staff at the Oberoi could read my mind! Treating my privacy very carefully they did everything to make my stay to a wonderful experience, I cannot express how I enjoyed this!

"This hotel's only drawback is a function of its vintage (1965) which means that rooms are on the small side and bathrooms are especially tiny with no room for a walk-in shower even in the suites.

The rooms are comfortably furnished and everything is immaculate. All even-numbered rooms face a vast park and golf course, assuring an excellent night's sleep.

It was perfect for my purpose...I was working anti-social hours, returning to the hotel at 1.30am and yet the room service was always prompt with a reasonably interesting menu. I was also therefore sleeping late but  - although the room was close to the lifts - it was extremely quiet.  The room itself was very comfortable with a well equipped bathroom, the public areas were attractive and the pool was excellent, allowing for some serious lengths.

The staff are were attentive beyond the call of duty, making it a point to remember our particular orders and drinks on a daily basis. The hotel was immaculate and the design modern and sleek. Loved the 360 concept of all types of foods - but I tend to stick to vegetarian indian when in India. Also loved the new pool and its design. The indoor pool is breathtaking. Spa treatments were excellent as was the service throughout the hotel.

It is hard to rate this hotel because some areas of the hotel, mainly the restaurants, room service, butler service, and housekeeping were extraordinary.  Definitely 5 stars, but in other areas the hotel failed and continued to fail even when there were was prior conversations or confirmations from staff.  Our extended room package included airport transfers.  The hotel sent two cars instead on one for two people.  And the issues continued.   We had two reservations, one for 7 nights, one day off to Agra, and then another 4 nights.  Upon check in, which happens in the room, the person told me we had not arrived last night.

"The Oberoi Delhi is an old school sanctuary in the middle of the bustle of Delhi. Its the sort of place that might feature in a James Bond film with Sean Connery. The exterior certainly looks it age, but inside you have the old world charm and elegance that is befitting the Oberoi name.   We use the word ""relative"" in the title because one must always remember that they are in Delhi, a fascinating city but one which does not have a plethora of world class hotels. Thus the Oberoi stands out among the pack for its elegance, sophistication and service.

Was there for a wedding for 2 nights.  Real crowded all the time due to a lot of business people around.  Rooms are ok.. not very big with small bathrooms also.   A silly problem which I faced was that the hotel kept the safes in the room locked and were not willing to open it for use. The explanation given was that people forget the codes!!!!! Made them open the safes for our use after a lot of pestering.  Their personal butlet service is very efficient.  Did not try the restaurants.

To give context to my review, I must state upfront that I normally don't stay at plush hotels such as the Oberoi so I do not have much to compare my stay with other than non-like hotels.  That said, I felt pampered and as well as valued as a guest at the Oberoi.  I arrived in the middle of the night and was picked up by the Hotel.  Upon arrival, I was promptly taken to my room and checked-in there instead of the front desk.  Room was fabulous and given the fact that I had just spent over 14 hours on a place, the bed was super.

"Built in 1965, it was one of the citys first luxury hotels. The exterior still bears the 60's-70's construction style, but the Oberoi in Delhi is a hotel with a reputaion for its style, service and elegance.  The rooms overlook either the greens of the Delhi Golf club, or Humayuns tomb (which is a world heritage site) on the other side. It is not one of your cheaper accomodation options though.   Baan Thai and Taipan, two of its restaurants, offer some of the finest oriental cuisine in town. Also, the Oberoi has undertaken to light up the adjacent `Humayuns tomb', which is a world heritage monument. The lights come on post sunset and its a fabulous view.

"Spent 3 nights at the Oberoi. At first glance, it doesn't seem so impressive since the hotel is in a rather non-descript building but upon close examination, it is furnished very tastefully with nice Indian antiques. Not loud or garish like some of these new hotels. The rooms itself are quite small but once again, it is full of small touches.   But the best thing about the hotel is the service. As this was the first part of our tour of India and also the first of the Oberoi stays, we had our first exposure to the marvellous service. Nothing was too much trouble whether it was the staff at the coffee house or  italian restaurant, housekeeping or front desk. And the big difference was that the service with the smile was genuine and sincere, something we don't often see. I would…",Date of stay: March 2010,bubble_50,

Although the welcome was great and buffet at their restaurant Threesixty was great (a little pricey), over all service in their function room was not so up to mark.

The one guilty pleasure that that I took advantage of was the on call butler service.  This came in handy at 4 in the morning the day I arrived, I just wanted someone to take my laudry then, and again the next day when I discovered I had left my razor at the last hotel.  Buzzed the butler and in 2 minutes I was presented a razor and gel.

"I have stayed at the Oberoi several times and enjoyed it. The difference this time was that the new infinity pool has been opened - and it is really lovely though not very deep. Also there is a nice landscaped area around the pool, with sun loungers. If you sit there the staff will bring complimentary bottles of cold water.  The ""old"" pool was closed as I think it is being re-done. But the indoor lap pool was still open.  Two things I don't like about this hotel: the breakfast buffet is not a particularly good selection of food for the price charged, and the service at breakfast (bringing toast and butter) is pretty chaotic.

We arrived early at the hotel and they arranged an early check with no issues.  Breakfast had a good range and quality of food.  The hotel is very business traveller orientated.  The Italian restaurant was average, but of course hotel prices.  The sunbathing/pool area was lovely, nice touch with the free water, suntan lotion and service button.  The exterior of the hotel building does not do it justice inside.  The location does not really allow you to wander around the local tourist sights.

Once arriving at the hotel, we where greeted by the staff with such style as they used our surname, which I like as it's nice and personal.

Taipan is rated the best in New Delhi - yummie Dim Sum. Three-Sixty has a great mix of cuisines - but the brunch buffet was over priced. We had wine at the enoteca, but did not try the cuisine.

The service of the hotel staff was excellent, ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast and dinner and found it to be very good.

The check-in takes less than a minute, they have all the details, all you have to do is sign and let them get an impression of your credit card.

We requested a non smoking room which they gave us, but the room left a great deal to be desired.

"Spent 6 nights for business in Executive Suite at rate of $350 USD per night.  As a point of reference, I travel world wide frequenlty and typically select higher end hotels. This was my 4th visit to India so I am very familiar with typical business accomodations, culture and potential language barriers.  2 room suite consisted of living area with table for 4, wet/mini bar, sofa, chair, coffee table, cabinet with 27"" tv and dvd player and a desk with fax machine.  Bedroom area was king size bed (very comfortable), another 27"" TV, dresser and dual closets.  Bath was standard with single sink, tub/shower combination and commode.  By business suite standards I would say that the room was cramped with too much furniture and decoration to be functional. The bathroom was also very…",Date of stay: September 2005,bubble_40,
My wife and I started our Indian holiday in this hotel (2 nights) and it whetted our appetite for things to come. Obviously a business hotel but also ideal for tourists. The Taipan restaurant on the top floor was excellent (food quality and service). ,Date of stay: September 2005,bubble_50,
"For a city hotel, this Oberoi is appealing both to business and tourist visitors. The rooms are spacious and cosy - try to get a room as high up as possible facing the golf course (we were on the 8th floor).   The pool is lovely & a great temperature. The room service was excellent however our dinner at 360 restaurant was fine, however, indicative of the rest of India, staff are unable to deal with problems. We ordered sushi as a starter, which was brought to our table with our main courses - when we complained there was no apology, only confusion!  Otherwise a lovely hotel. ",,bubble_50,
"We spent a total of 3 nights in The Oberoi in New Delhi. The first was as part of the exotic vacation package on our way between Udaipur and Agra. Just an overnighter. A large, modern hotel, with a warm welcome. They gave us a great room overlooking the golf course. Super view. Rooms were good, not as large as their destination hotels in Jaipur and Udaipur, but well appoineted with good cupboard space and good bathrooms. Comparable to a good 5 star hotel anywhere. An excellent concierge. The second stay occured on our return from the Oberoi in Agra (the only place to stay) when we had a confirmed booking at the Imperial (check out my review). Due to the Imperial's inability to provide us with a room we ended up on short notice back at the Oberoi hotel. They gave us one of the…",Date of stay: September 2005,bubble_50,
"This hotel was our first stop on our honeymoon trip through India so I was a bit nervous it might be a disappointment, but we were pleasantly surprised by everything - an Oberoi driver picked us up at the airport, offered us bottled water & cold towels and pointed out interesting spots on the way to the hotel. Once there we were greeted with a traditional bindi ceremony and whisked up to our room (we checked in once there). The room was more inviting than the online pictures seemed to suggest, with wood panelling and a fluffy white bed.  Another nice discovery was that the water is filtered so you don't need to worry about brushing your teeth with bottled water or the like (though they do leave extra bottles around for the faint of heart).   Breakfast was simply lovely in a very…",Date of stay: August 2005,bubble_50,
"We stayed here in November and December 2004, at the beginning and end of a tour of Rajasthan. It was thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing. Rooms not huge or particularly spectacular but on a short tourist stay in Delhi one hardly spends any time in one's room! Lovely public areas, gym, pool and spa and beautifully designed new 360 restaurant/bar where breakfast is also served. Ate in the Thai restaurant (very good) and the Tandoori restaurant (particularly good, especially the friendly tandoori chefs who gave us a personalised demonstration of chapatti making!) as well as the new Italian restaurant. The latter was obviously making a big effort and despite difficulty booking a table via reception, a couple of minor ""teething troubles"" (eg a somewhat short white wine selection) were…",Date of stay: November 2004,bubble_40,
"Stayed at the Oberoi for a long weekend with friends.  Arrived around 1am. My luggage was taken straight to my room. I found the room to be quite small, but decorated very tastefully with everything I needed. Ordered room service, which came pretty quickly and was absolutely delicious, very cheap also.  The breakfast bar was well stocked, I think this area of the hotel has been newly refurbished, as it looked different to the website pics. Very beautifully done - should have taken a picture.  The pool and grounds are lovely and there are snacks and drinks that can be ordered from your sun lounger. I opted for a mango daquiri cocktail, which was just out of this world.  Spent some time in the 360 bar, which is an open plan bar and restaurant. This is a very hip place to hang out…",Date of stay: April 2005,bubble_50,
"The Oberoi Hotels have established a world-class reputation, and deservedly so (they are normally beyond impeccable) - but the Oberoi New Delhi, is, alas, a weaker link. Though the hotel's rooms and public spaces are quite attractive, the service is somewhat impersonal and spotty. For example, we were overcharged for various items on both occasions we stayed there. Also, we were given a non-smoking room that reeked of smoke, but when we complained, the staff did nothing (we had to ask twice before the room was freshened). In addition, at one of the restaurants, they were quite pushy about asking us to fill out an evaluation form, and at the spa, the masseuse handed me an evaluation form on which boxes had already been ticked off to say the service exceeded expectations (the…",Date of stay: April 2005,bubble_30,
"I've been through a few Hotels in Delhi over the years(Hilton, Hyatts, Marriott, Sofitel, Taj etc), but for some reason, I never used the Oberoi. excellent rooms, good bed with different pillows and a sufficient work desk. The living room(I had a Suite) could have been bigger, though, you always come across the furniture. That's not comparable to SEA Hotels.  The Hotel offers Wireless LAN Connectivity in the whole Hotel, a definite improvement from all the other Hotels and I have suffered from poor analog lines in various business centres in other hotels in Delhi.  I did not use the Pool, but it looked good and was cleaned every day.  The breakfast and Restaurants were excellent, again the best I've seen so far(far better then the Grand Hyatt, when it opened), in particular the…",Date of stay: April 2005,bubble_50,
"This is a beautiful and luxurious hotel. Unfortunately for the price, I'd have expected the service to have been better. I had a problem with the door lock on my room - the battery needed replacing, a simple job yet I was locked out of my room for an unacceptable amount of time (over two hours!), so went to the spa in the meantime. The spa was amazing with a vast array of ayurvedic treatments on offer - unfortunately the spa was severely understaffed and all the appointments were taken up for the rest of the day!!!!! I booked a luxury room with heritage furniture which although very tastefuly done it didn't remind me of the Raj style of decor I had imagined - certainly not compared to the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. Having said all of this, the restaurants were absolutely…",Date of stay: January 2005,bubble_30,
"Hotel is fine and food is good although pricey compared to competition.  However, watch out for the direct-dial telephone charges - FOUR times as much as competitors and SEVEN times as much as many good hotels in India.  Indeed, one dollar only gets you a few seconds intenationally! ",,bubble_20,"Dear Guest,  I apologize for the delayed response.  I seek another opportunity where I wish to be personally involved to ensure that your stay is most memorable.
